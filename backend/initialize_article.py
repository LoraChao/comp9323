Step 1 – Get leadership support  
Taking action for good mental health starts at the top.

Get the support of your leadership or executive team so they can help drive positive change in your organisation. 

Leadership sets the tone, culture and policies across a business, so genuine engagement from the top will drive positive change.  

Get the support of your leadership by:

finding out how your business is tracking in being mentally healthy with our Workplace Pulse Check. Your results will show how you compare with your industry. Share your results with your leadership team and discuss what actions can be taken to improve
talking to your leaders about why mental health is important to your team and the benefits a mentally healthy workplace can have on the business’ bottom line. HeadsUp’s Return on Investment toollaunch tells you how much money you could save
asking your leadership to share their commitment to creating a mentally healthy workplace with the whole organisation.
it's important for leaders to empower everyone in the workplace with adequate resources and ensure everyone understands their legal obligations.

Step 2 – Consult with your team
Ask your team what changes would better support their health and wellbeing.  

Your workers know best what they need to do their jobs effectively. Talk to them.

It is important to consult with your team throughout the whole process about what workplace factors are affecting them and how you can provide a working environment that supports their mental health and wellbeing at work.

You can do this through:

staff surveys, focus groups, workshops or one-on-one conversations  
regular check-ins on improvements or adjustments for continual improvement
genuine communication with your team regularly and transparently
finding your mental health champions - start up a team of people in your workplace who are passionate about creating a mentally healthy workplace and discuss opportunities to make a difference.
Icon with checklist with green check marks.
Step 3 – Identify factors and analyse data
Often the information needed to understand and identify factors impacting mental health in your workplace already exists or can easily be obtained.  

Take this approach:

continue the consultation process to understand your team's perspective
analyse your human resources data such as unplanned leave, workers compensation claims, access to support services and tools, and reports of bullying and harassment
use our Workplace Pulse Check to help you understand how your workplace is tracking with providing a mentally healthy environment.  It'll give you actions on how to improve
the People at Work toollaunch can also help you identify psychosocial risk factors.
You also need to consider:

the unique factors that the nature of your workplace and the type of work carried out creates
the cumulative effect of work demands on your employees over time.
This data and feedback will help you understand what areas need to be addressed as you form your action plan.

Icon of green numbered list.
Step 4 - Make a plan
The next step is to take the information you’ve gathered and put it into an action plan.

Having your plan documented will help ensure you stay on track, allowing risks to be mitigated and mental ill-health supported.

Your plan should contain specific and achievable initiatives and actions that can be measured and monitored.

Remember to consider the factors that you identified in step 3 and outline actions to manage each one.

Your action plan should focus on these three areas:

Promote good healthkeyboard_arrow_down
Manage risks to mental healthkeyboard_arrow_down

Step 5 – Put your plan into action
Your plan needs to be put into action, not just sit on a shelf.

Your plan and policies will work best when they’re clearly and effectively communicated to everyone in your workplace. 

Be sure to include it in induction training and make sure it’s easily accessible in hard and soft copy.  This helps you continue the consultation throughout the process.

Step 6 – Evaluate and improve
The journey to a mentally healthy workplace is a process of continuous learning, consultation, feedback and improvement.  

Make sure you:

keep a record of all the workplace factors identified and the actions taken to address them. 
check-in with your team all the time – are things improving? Has there been a positive change in culture? What more can be done? 
look at your business data – are you seeing a reduction in unplanned leave or increased productivity?

(0,"Take action to be a mentally healthy workplace","NSW gov","Key information
Mentally healthy workplaces continually promote good mental health and manage risks to mental health.
Safe work practices and a positive work culture are critical to a mentally healthy workplace.
Mentally healthy workplaces encourage workers to seek help early and support recovery at work.
There are simple, practical actions you can take immediately to promote workplace mental health.
Promote good health
Promoting mental health and wellbeing in the workplace can help create a supportive and inclusive culture while also reducing stigma and opening up communication.

Meaningful promotion of mental health must start at the top. All levels of leadership must commit to building and supporting a mentally healthy workplace for all.

There are five key actions you can take to help ensure mental health is top of mind in your workplace.

Talk and listen 
Our day-to-day interactions have the biggest impact on workplace culture. Take opportunities to check in with staff and colleagues. Get to know them and build strong relationships. This will open the door for people to be more comfortable to seek help when needed.

Use regular one-on-one meetings with staff to check in on workloads, expectations, training needs and the requirements of their role. Regular discussion on these topics can prevent issues that cause mental ill-health.

If you notice changes in a team member's performance or behaviour, check in with them. Let them know you've noticed changes and seek to understand what could be going on for them and what they might need support with.

Other ideas to engage staff on mental health topics:

Take opportunities like R U OK? Day and Mental Health month to hold social events, share case studies and promote resources.
Regularly demonstrate a business-wide commitment to a mentally healthy workplace through internal communications, tools and resources.
Train peer support leaders or mental health champions to create a wide network of people for staff to seek support.
Have active systems, policies and procedures
Having systems in place to mitigate risks and ensure success is part of running a profitable business. The same principles apply to creating a mentally healthy workplace and being an employer of choice. 

Having mental health and wellbeing integrated into your safety systems and documented in policies and procedures can help everyone understand the business expectations around behaviour, reporting and support. It also demonstrates your leadership's commitment to staff health and safety.

Mental health policies work best when they are clearly and effectively communicated to everyone.

Make sure that you:

Seek feedback from staff on draft policies to make sure they are easily understood and work for your people.
Share them with your team when they do their induction or when a policy is updated, created or breached.
Make the policies easily accessible to everyone (without people needing to ask for them).
Review your safety systems regularly including your policies and procedures to make sure they keep up with business changes.
Our free one-on-one business coaching can help you create or review these policies.

Support a flexible workplace
By being flexible in the way work is delivered, you will support the needs of your team and create benefits including improved work-life balance, increased productivity, reduced absenteeism and improved morale. 

In some circumstances, employees have a right to requestlaunch flexible working arrangements. 

Flexibility will look different in each workplace, but the aim is to provide your team with options that work best for their personal circumstances and your business needs. 

Flexibility can include: 

different daily or weekly work hours and/or start and finish times 
staggered rosters 
part-time or job share roles 
hybrid working from home and/or remotely. 
Build your flexible workplace by: 

talking to each of your workers to understand what works best for them 
building a flexible working policy that sets out the principles for everyone to follow to ensure consistent and fair access to flexibility   
checking in and reviewing regularly to see if anything can be improved.

Recognise good work
Recognising the efforts and achievements of staff makes them feel that their work is acknowledged and valued. This can lead to higher engagement, increased productivity and positive morale.

Regular discussions on task performance, overall performance reviews, and development planning create opportunities to provide recognition.

You can give recognition through formal or informal rewards. You might consider starting a rewards program, sharing positive feedback, celebrating both individual and team wins, and providing opportunities for career development.

SafeWork NSW has more tips on recognition and rewardlaunch.

Provide training
Workplace mental health training can help you and your team promote and manage wellbeing. It can also help you better understand how to look after yourself and support others at work. 

There are three types of training that support mental health at work: 

Prevention – how to stay mentally well. 
Responding – how to act on warning signs of mental ill-health.
Recovery – how to support people with mental illness to recover. 
Workplace mental health training teaches you how to provide the right support at the right time. 

Choose a workplace mental health training provider that: 

delivers training via a mode of delivery that suits you
delivers training tailored to your business (for example, the factors you need addressed) or your industry
delivers a program that has been proven to achieve results
provides a facilitator who is suitably trained and experienced.

A risk management approach to controlling exposure to factors that are known to impact mental health can ensure staff safety and create a culture that enables staff to bring their best to work.

The following actions should be part of your part of your plan to a creating a mentally healthy workplace.

Have good work design
Good work design is about creating work that is healthy, safe and productive by preventing or reducing the impact of factors or hazards in the workplace. Good work design supports everyone to do their best work, leading to job satisfaction and higher productivity.

To achieve good work design, you should:

Consider what is involved in performing each work task, including who is responsible, who else needs to be involved and the complexity of the task.
Consult with staff doing the work about how the work could best be completed.
Identify any workplace factors that need to be addressed.
Ensure the work is appropriate for your workers’ experience and skills and achievable, given the workload and resources available.
Continually review workloads and resources and consult with your workers on how they manage and perform their jobs.

Review and evaluate work design regularly by asking your employees for feedback.

Review work design when changes occur, for example work from home requirements or organisational changes.

Provide role clarity
Role clarity is about ensuring that everyone in your workplace understands what is expected of them. The also need to understand why and how their work will be assessed and by who.

This helps reduce stress and confusion so everyone can feel productive, motivated and engaged.

Role clarity doesn’t end with providing a job description. It’s about making sure each employee understands:

their job role and requirements
responsibilities and outcomes they must achieve
how their role fits into the business’s overall outcomes and objectives
who they report to.
You should check in regularly with your employees to make sure work expectations are clear and understood. Help them to develop work plans with clear tasks, time-frames and outputs.

You should also regularly give and seek feedback and assess if any training or development could help your employees in their role.

SafeWork NSW has more tips about providing role claritylaunch.

Monitor workload
To help reduce workplace stress, you should monitor the workload of your employees regularly to ensure they are not having to work excess hours to get their work done.

You can do this by:

Discussing individual workloads in one-on-one catch ups.
Encouraging people to discuss workloads at team meetings so tasks can be shared fairly.
Setting realistic work schedules, clearly prioritising tasks and promoting flexibility where possible.
Making adjustments to roles or tasks if needed or starting a roster to prevent fatigue.
Promote a zero tolerance of bullying
Everyone at work can help ensure that bullying does not occur. Workplace bullying includes repeated behaviour like abusive or humiliating comments, aggression or unjustified criticism and complaints. Discrimination and harassment are also behaviours that contribute to bullying.

Make sure your workplace has a zero tolerance for bullying and a workplace anti-bullying policy that is promoted by your leadership and understood by everyone.

There needs to be a clear process for bullying to be reported and responded to quickly.

Prevent violence and aggression
Everyone has the right to work in a workplace where they are physically safe. Violence and aggression at work can cause both physical and psychological injuries to your employees.

Violence and aggression can include physical abuse and assault as well as threats of violent behaviour from clients, members of the public or other workers in your organisation.

You can prevent injuries from violence by:

consulting with your workers to identify risky situations
changing where and how work is done to minimise risks
having policies on acceptable behaviour and how to report incidents of violence if they occur, so they can be investigated.

Build a positive and inclusive culture
Building a positive and inclusive culture helps people feel valued and supported at work, which can increase productivity.

You can do this by:

Encouraging everyone to participate in making decisions about their workplace, for example, through surveys, discussions and workshops.
Encouraging social connection and creating opportunities for colleagues to get to know each other.
Recognising and celebrating diversity and differences. Be respectful. Make everyone feel like they belong and that work is a safe place to be.
Recognising and rewarding staff achievements and hard work helps people feel like their contribution is valued.
Talking about wellbeing and feelings of stress or burnout at work to help reduce stigma. Start the conversation.

Support early help-seeking and recovery
Seeking help early can reduce the impact and severity of poor mental health, and allows your people to be their best. Sometimes people may not notice the changes within themselves or be aware they need help. 

Nearly 1 in 6 workers are experiencing poor mental health at any given time, which means mental ill-health is likely to be in your workplace - whether it's recogised or not. We bring our whole selves to work and most of us will need support at some time. 

Nearly 1 in 6 Australian employees experience mental illness in their lifetime. lifetime.
Know the signs and act early
Good support from managers and colleagues can help people manage stress, encourage them to seek help early and recover at work. 

As a people leader, you don’t have to be a mental health expert to support your team. All it takes is the ability to notice when things aren’t right, starting a conversation to check in, and connecting people to support if they need it.  

If you notice changes in your workers’ productivity, mood, behaviour or appearance, it can be a sign that they need support. 

If you’re concerned, it’s important to act early by starting a conversationlaunch with them and connecting them with support services if they need it.  

Ways you can ensure your workplace is able to provide support include:  

Build a supportive culture with open communication so people feel like they can talk openly when they need to.
Actively promote your workplace counselling service or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). If you don't have these services in your workplace, there are many free support services, tools and resources available. Share these with your team regularly, so they know where to go if they need support.
Sign up for  mental health training with your team so everyone knows how to recognise the signs and act early.
Have peer support or health champions in your workplace, who promote positive behaviour and are trained to recognise early signs of mental illness and connect people to support. 
Learn how to support your team if they are working from home or remotelylaunch. 
Support staff to recover at work
Supporting people living with mental ill-health to recover at work benefits everyone. Workers often recover sooner, it helps retain workers’ skills and experience, creates a positive and inclusive culture, and avoids the cost of recruiting and onboarding new staff.  

How can you support recovery at work?  

Talk – have a conversation with your team member privately about their situation and offer support.  
Plan – discuss, agree, and write down goals for your team member's return to work. Make workplace adjustments to support their mental health at work.
Stay connected – organise to keep in touch regularly and make changes to their plan as needed.  
Create a peer support network
A peer support program enables people to talk to peers who have had similar work or life experience. This is a great early intervention method as people are often more comfortable speaking to their peers as opposed to their manager. 

Peer supporters can be volunteers from your workplace who receive training to use their lived experience of mental ill health, or a peer worker specifically employed based on their personal lived experience plus other skills required for their role. They use their lived experience to provide support, model hope for recovery and connect people to other support if it is needed. 

Train peer supporters with off-the-shelf training programs, or engage an organisational psychologist or workplace wellbeing provider to customise and deliver training tailored for your workplace.

(0,"Mental health","Jenny Davies","Before the onset of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, an estimated one in six adults in England experienced a common mental health condition each week. Inequalities in mental health persisted, with some groups facing poorer mental health and barriers to accessing services. And in England and Wales, suicide was the leading cause of death for people aged 20 to 34 years.

As with all parts of the health system, the pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health services. The number of referrals fell and trusts have reported an increase in the number of people presenting in crisis. Symptoms of common mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, have increased. This raises concerns about a future surge in demand for support from services which were already under strain.

Here at QualityWatch, we’ve been monitoring how the quality of mental health care has changed over time. While some measures, such as waiting times for children and young people with an eating disorder, show an improvement, other measures, such as follow-up care for adults discharged from psychiatric inpatient care, have not improved. A summary of our mental health indicators is shown below. Click on the links for more detailed content and analysis.

Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme
See the indicator >>

The number of referrals to the IAPT programme starting treatment increased from 533,550 in 2011/12 to 1,165,747 in 2019/20. But the number of people starting treatment must still increase considerably if the 2023/24 target of 1.88 million people is to be reached.
Between February and April 2020, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of referrals to IAPT more than halved and the number of referrals starting treatment fell by 24%. In August 2020 there were 116,102 referrals to IAPT (11% lower than in August 2019) and 79,281 referrals started treatment (12% lower than in August 2019).
The number of people successfully finishing a course of treatment increased between 2012/13 and 2016/17, but since then improvement has stalled. In Q1 2020/21, 167,655 people successfully finished a course of treatment.
The recovery rate increased gradually between Q1 2012/13 and Q4 2018/19, from 46% to 53%. Since then, it has decreased to 50% in Q1 2020/21. The target recovery rate of 50% was first achieved in Q4 2016/17, but has not been met for the past two quarters.
Children and young people with an eating disorder waiting times
See the indicator >>

Between Q1 2016/17 and Q2 2020/21, the percentage of children and young people with an eating disorder starting urgent treatment within one week of referral increased from 65% to 85%.
The percentage of routine/non-urgent cases starting treatment within four weeks of referral increased from 65% in Q1 2016/17 to 90% in Q2 2020/21.
Between Q1 2016/17 and Q1 2020/21, the number of children and young people starting treatment each quarter following an urgent referral fluctuated at around 300. In Q2 2020/21 (July to September 2020), the number of urgent referrals starting treatment increased to 625.
Hospital admissions as a result of self-harm in children and young people
See the indicator >>

Rates of hospital admission as a result of self-harm in children and young people (aged 10-24) are considerably higher for females than males. Between 2012/13 and 2018/19, the rate for females increased from 508 per 100,000 population to 690 per population. Over the same time period, the rate for males fluctuated around 200 admissions per 100,000 population.
In 2018/19, the South West had the highest rate of admissions at 679 per 100,000 population. The rate was lowest in London at 196 per 100,000 population.
Out of area placements
See the indicator >>

An out of area placement occurs when a person with acute mental health needs who requires inpatient care is admitted to a unit that does not form part of their usual network of services.
Between September 2017 and February 2020, the number of inappropriate out of area placements started each month increased from 586 to 665. In March 2020, the number started began to fall reaching a low of 210 in April. This may reflect changes in mental health inpatient care use due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since April, the number started each month has increased and in August, 575 inappropriate out of area placements were started.
In August 2020, there were 50 inappropriate out of area placements that required patients to travel a distance of 300km or greater. There were 140 inappropriate out of area placements that required patients to travel more than 200km but less than 300km.
Follow-up care for adults with mental health problems
See the indicator >>

The national threshold states that at least 95% of patients should be followed up within seven days of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care. This target was consistently met until Q2 2019/20, when performance dropped to 94.5%. In Q3 2019/20, the proportion followed up within seven days increased slightly to 95.5%.
Suicide in mental health service users
See the indicator >>

In 2017, there were 1,216 suicides in England by people who had been in contact with mental health services in the previous 12 months. In Scotland there were 223 patient suicides and in Wales there were 78.
Between 2006 and 2017, the number of suicides by people in contact with mental health services in the previous 12 months increased by 8% in England. The rate of patient suicide, taking into account the rising number of people receiving mental health care, decreased from 98 to 48 suicides per 100,000 mental health service users over the same time period.
International comparisons of mental health outcomes
See the indicator >>

The rate of inpatient suicide in all comparator countries is less than 2 per 1,000 patients. The UK has consistently had one of the lowest rates of inpatient suicide, although internationally comparable data on the quality of mental health care is limited.
The UK’s suicide rate within 30 days of discharge from hospital among patients diagnosed with a mental disorder is consistently the lowest of the comparator countries for which there is available data.
Service users’ experience of community mental health services
See the indicator >>

The Community Mental Health Survey asks service users to rate their overall experience from 0 (very poor) to 10 (very good). In 2020, 19% of service users rated their overall experience as very good and 3% rated their experience as very poor. *
The proportion of Community Mental Health Survey respondents who ‘definitely’ felt they were given enough time to discuss their needs and treatment has decreased over time, from 65% in 2014 to 57% in 2019. In 2020, 59% of respondents felt they were ‘definitely’ given enough time. *
In 2020, 72% of Community Mental Health Survey respondents said they knew who to contact out of hours within the NHS if they had a crisis. *
Of those who knew who to contact out of hours and had tried in the previous 12 months, in 2020 over half (52%) of respondents said that they ‘definitely’ got the help they needed when they tried to make contact. 17% of respondents did not get the help they needed and 2% were not able to make contact. *
Respect and dignity
See the indicator >>

Between 2014 and 2019, the percentage of Community Mental Health Survey respondents who said that they were ‘always’ treated with respect and dignity decreased from 74% to 71%. The proportion who felt that they were not treated with respect and dignity increased slightly from 7% to 8% over the same time period.
In 2020, 73% of respondents felt that they were ‘always’ treated with respect and dignity and 8% felt that they were not. *
Do patients feel involved in decisions about their care?
See the indicator >>

The Community Mental Health Survey asks respondents if they were involved as much as they wanted to be in agreeing what care they receive. Between 2014 and 2019, the proportion of respondents who were ‘definitely’ involved as much as they wanted to be decreased from 56% to 52%.
In 2020, 53% of respondents said they were ‘definitely’ involved as much as they wanted to be and 8% said they were not involved, but wanted to be. *
* Fieldwork for the 2020 Community Mental Health Survey was carried out between February and June. Analysis found that the scale of changes made by services due to the Covid-19 pandemic varied between trusts. Some trusts received the majority of their survey responses before the pandemic, while others received all responses during the lockdown. Therefore, results are not considered comparable to previous years.

Are patients told about medication side effects?

In 2020, less than half (43%) of Community Mental Health Survey respondents said that they were ‘definitely’ told about possible medication side effects. This compares to 44% of Urgent and Emergency Care Survey respondents and only 37% of Adult Inpatient Survey respondents.",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"Striking increase in mental health conditions in children and young people","Anonymous","The proportion of children and young people saying they have a mental health condition has grown six fold in England over two decades and has increased significantly across the whole of Britain in recent years, new research reveals.

In 1995, just 0.8% of 4-24 year olds in England reported a long-standing mental health condition. By 2014 this had increased to 4.8%. Looking across England, Scotland and Wales using data between 2008 and 2014, reports of a mental health condition in England and Scotland, and reports of treatment for one in Wales, grew by 60%, 75% and 41% respectively.

That’s according to the first national-level study in over a decade to investigate trends in mental health problems in children and young people in the UK. Published today in the Psychological Medicine journal, the study is a collaboration between academics at University College London, Imperial College London, Exeter University and the Nuffield Trust. Researchers analysed data from 140,830 participants aged between 4 and 24 years, in 36 national surveys in England, Scotland and Wales over time.

The researchers analysed responses to questions asking children and young people (or parents for the 4-12 year age group) for a yes/no answer on whether they had any ‘long-standing mental health condition’ (any ‘currently treated mental health problem’ in Wales) and compared this to general long-standing health conditions (both physical and mental). They also looked at questions where responses indicated emotional or psychological distress.

In an accompanying blog on the Nuffield Trust website, research lead Dr Dougal Hargreaves says these findings could point to a widening gap between the mental health needs of children and young people and the services available. However, he also argues that the increase in prevalence tracked in this study suggests a greater willingness among children and young people to open up about mental health issues and a better awareness of mental health.

Key findings include:

Between 1995 and 2014 the proportion of children and young people aged 4-24 in England reporting a long-standing mental health condition increased six fold, meaning that by 2014 almost one in twenty children and young people in England reported having a mental health condition.
In 2008, when comparable data from the other two countries was available, 3% of 4-24 year olds in England and 3.7% in Scotland said they had a long-standing mental health condition, with 2.9% of 4-24 year olds in Wales saying they had received treatment. By 2014 these figures had grown to 4.8% in England, 6.5% in Scotland and 4.1% in Wales.
The age group with the biggest increases were young people aged 16-24, with young people in England almost 10 times  more likely to report a long-standing mental health condition in 2014 than in 1995 (5.9% vs. 0.6%).
Young boys aged 4-12 were consistently more likely to report a long-standing mental health condition than young girls. This was true across all countries. There was less of a consistent gender pattern in the 12-15 and 16-24 age groups.
Over the corresponding time period, the prevalence of total long standing conditions (both physical and mental) decreased slightly in England (20.3 to 19.5%,), increased slightly in Scotland (17.6% to 22.0%) and was broadly unchanged in Wales (13.1% vs. 13.5%).
Long-term trends in reported symptoms of mental health problems (as opposed to reports of a long-standing condition) showed no consistent evidence of an increase in emotional distress. However, the most recent evidence (from 2011-2014) showed concerning early signs of worsening emotional or psychological distress among young adults. For example, the odds of reporting above-threshold symptoms of emotional distress increased by 15% per year among young adults in Scotland.
Commenting on the findings, Dr Dougal Hargreaves of Imperial College London and a Visiting Research Analyst at the Nuffield Trust said:

“We know that there is already a growing crisis in the availability of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, with many more children and young people needing treatment than there are services to provide it. Our study suggests that this need is likely to continue to grow in future. Without more radical action to improve access to and funding for CAMHS, as well as a wider strategy to promote positive mental health and wellbeing, we may be letting down some of the most vulnerable in society.

“But it’s not all bad news. The increase in reports of long-standing mental health conditions may also mean that children and young people are more willing to open up about their mental health, suggesting that we have made some progress in reducing the stigma associated with mental ill health.”",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"Improving young people’s mental health care","Dr Rakhee Shah","The recent QualityWatch report on emergency hospital care for children and young people outlined how young people’s use of emergency care has changed over ten years. Overall there has been a 6% increase in hospital emergency admission rates across all children between 2006/7 and 2015/16. However it is important to note that the number of emergency admissions amongst 10-19 year olds actually dropped during the ten year period, indicating that the increase in emergency admissions by children are attributable to the under 10s. Whilst we need to better understand the increase in admissions for children there are also trends that need further exploration for young people. The most notable is that the older age group showed some increases in admissions associated with specific conditions such as abdominal pain and poisoning.

Strikingly, there was a 27% increase in re-admission to hospital within 30 days amongst children and young people admitted for poisoning by other medications and drugs, which is more prevalent in the 10-24 age group. These figures indicate that we may be failing to provide our young people with adequate mental health treatment prior to discharge and, more importantly, failing to provide ongoing support in the community.

The question is why are we failing this particular group? It is clear that one of the reasons is that the clinical thresholds to receive statutory child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are high. It is approximated that the prevalence of mental health problems in young people aged 16-25 is 10%, yet analysis from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey shows that even in those that have severe mental health problems, almost half (46%) were not receiving mental health care.

Second, there is evidence to show that the prevalence of mental health problems such as common mental disorders and self-harm are on the rise, particularly in young women aged 16-24 who have emerged as a high-risk group.

Third, there have been cuts to government-funded early intervention programmes including positive activities for young people, and services for teenage pregnancy, alcohol and drug use, which may be contributing to young people having more severe mental health problems.

In the long term we need to focus on preventing the ‘upstream factors’ that contribute towards mental health problems, which include investing in resilience training in schools, providing access to high-quality education and health services, and decreasing deprivation. We need to ensure that early support services are in place for young people who are identified as being at risk of developing mental health problems, for example for young people presenting with stress and emotional difficulties. These early intervention services will help prevent mental health problems developing in the long term.

Helping today’s patients
However, what needs to be done to help our young people who are currently experiencing mental health problems? There was consensus at the Nuffield Trust roundtable discussion that to reduce the readmission rate amongst children and young people following self-harm would require a whole system approach. It is important to up-skill people who engage with young people on a regular basis such as teachers, school nurses, youth workers, general practitioners, paediatricians, doctors in A&E, and others. These practitioners need to recognise, risk assess and refer young people to mental health services at an earlier stage, which may in the long term reduce the severity of mental health conditions presenting to A&E.

Young people and their parents should be provided with an option to self-refer to a triage service that can assess the severity of the condition and signpost young people to appropriate mental health services. Both young people and parents, if given the option, may present to mental health services earlier prior to symptoms escalating, and be treated more appropriately in the community, reducing A&E attendances.

We must not forget the key role that parents play in supporting and contributing towards successful outcomes for young people with mental health problems. Enabling parents to become part of the solution includes developing parent support groups, developing services where parents can receive more practical advice about how to manage crises to prevent escalation requiring hospitalisation, and providing parents with liaison staff or a case-worker who can guide them on where to get further help.

System pressures
Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are stretched and the service requires an increased workforce to meet the increasing demand in order to be able to review discharged patients in a timely manner.

One idea debated at the roundtable event was whether changing CAMHS contracts from block to outcomes based payments could potentially incentivise improvements in mental health outcomes for young people. Currently, the majority of CAMHS services are under block contracts, which means that payments are made in advance on a regular basis to provide child and adolescent mental health services both in acute and community settings. Payments are independent of the actual number of patients treated or activity levels, but can be varied based on patient need or historical expenditure.

Although block contracts are predictable, flexible (as payments are not related to one particular activity) and have low transaction costs, they have been criticised for a lack of accountability and transparency. Payment by results (PbR) or outcomes based payments are used by the government to fund child health services in the acute sector and NHS England have stated that they want to move towards evidence-based, outcome-focused improvements in mental health services working in collaboration with children, young people and their families. A consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach is important as we move forward. Those present at the roundtable discussion felt there was potential for an outcomes based payment system to support innovation and introduce new models of care that respond to young people’s needs. It was also recognised that outcomes of CAMHS services are influenced by a complexity of factors and that this also needs to be taken into consideration.

Voluntary sector role
More recently, the emerging role of social prescribing and voluntary organisations in improving outcomes for young people with mental ill-health has come into the spotlight, as research shows that mental health problems can be caused by social and environmental factors. Social prescribing and support services provided by non-medical organisations can play a key role in providing early interventions for young people and their families at risk of developing mental health problems.

Development of new models of mental health care are key to improving mental health outcomes and reducing readmissions to hospital following self-harm for young people, but it is important to ensure young people’s views are at central, enabling services to be more accessible and age-appropriate. Young people, when consulted during a social prescribing project for emotional health and wellbeing in Rochdale, suggested the best forms of emotional support could include a telephone service where they can speak to people, video consultations and informal support signposting to other services. Increased awareness about local non–medical sources of support within the community amongst healthcare professionals, teachers and youth workers is required to appropriately signpost young people with stress and emotional difficulties.

In order to improve young people’s mental health outcomes, in view of limited resources with financial cuts being made in the NHS and other services, now is the time to stop working in silos and come together (government funded sectors and voluntary organisations) to provide strong leadership and advocate at a national level for more investment in whole community approaches.",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"A 'catch 22' for mental health patients’ physical care","Dr Vivek Srivastava","We looked at 552 cases, across 208 hospitals, of patients with mental ill-health admitted to general hospitals with physical illness. We found good quality care in just 46% of cases reviewed. 23.7% had room for improvement in clinical care and 16.1% had room for improvement in the organisation of care. In 11.7% of cases we found a need for improvement in both clinical and organisational aspects of care.

What are the reasons behind this poor care, and what can hospitals do about it?

Only 95 of the 208 hospitals had mandatory training for staff on managing sick patients with mental health conditions. This lack of appropriate training in many cases points to an issue about staff not having the confidence to care for patients with mental ill-health. Once someone is admitted to hospital it is likely to expose any underlying health issues such as a mental health condition, and staff need to have the confidence to deal with it, and have access to hospital mental health services.

We also found that about 19.6% hospitals did not have a liaison psychiatry service. Where the service was available it was staffed at all times of the day in only 50% of hospitals. Additionally, the service did not cover all the emergency areas and wards in 15% of hospitals.

The majority of patients in the cases reviewed (63.6%) were admitted via the hospital Emergency Department (ED), with a significant minority (14.5%) referred by their GP. We found ED notes to be inconsistent in documenting the mental health condition with only 73 patients having it noted out of the 96 cases where it should have been documented. We also found a similar lack of documentation of a patient’s mental health condition in GP referral letters and in the medical clerking on the ward.

It is now accepted that patients with a severe mental health illness develop medical ill health at least a decade earlier in their lives and die 15 to 25 years younger as a consequence. The rise in mortality is associated with conditions like heart disease at a younger age, often linked to their medications, smoking and obesity.

An example that highlights poor physical treatment in primary and secondary care is the failure to provide stop smoking services routinely to people with mental health conditions. Our study found high levels of smoking among the patients we reviewed - over a third (39.7%) were documented as smokers, compared to 19% of adults in the general population. However, only a minority received effective smoking cessation support.

During in-hospital care some patients need one-to-one mental health observations (sometimes called specialling). But, we found it was inadequate in 68% of cases, primarily because it was given to staff members not adequately trained in that role.

After admission, 22.5% of the patients were referred to the liaison psychiatry team, but lack of timely referral in another 10% compromised their care. Also, ward assessment by liaison psychiatry was significantly delayed in 37.2% cases, which adversely impacted on the quality of care for some patients. The most common reason documented for the delay was “the liaison psychiatry team would not attend until the patient was declared medically fit”. This is a ‘catch-22’ because in many cases physical health and mental health are closely linked. NCEPOD has called for the practice to be discouraged in favour of joint assessment and collaborative management of physical and mental health.

One in four of us will suffer a mental health condition in our lives, and we need to take mental healthcare in hospitals as seriously as physical healthcare, and learn how to provide care for the mind and the body.",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"How can we improve access to children’s mental health services?","Lucia Kossarova","A recent report from the Independent Commission on Children and Young People’s Mental Health is the latest in a long string of research drawing attention to the poor state of children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).

What do we know about these problems and what can be done?

Access is patchy
For a start, children and young people often have trouble accessing treatment, information and support for their mental health.

Nearly a quarter of children referred to children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are being turned away. The reason? Their condition is not seen to be serious enough; in some areas their referral is only accepted if the condition has a major impact on “the child’s life such as an inability to attend school or a major breakdown in family relationships”.

We also know that there is wide variation in how long children and young people (CYP) wait to access CAMHS. The median waiting time across all providers is one month for a first appointment and two months until start of the treatment. However, some children and young people may wait as long as six months for a first appointment and 10 months for start of treatment. Late intervention has not only a significant human and social – potentially irreversible – cost on the lives of children, young people and their families, but also a financial one.

Young people don’t know where to turn for help
Secondly, we know that there are very high rates of self-harm in younger people yet, when in crisis, they often don’t know where to seek help.

The 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey found that self-harm has been increasing over time. In 2014 one in five young adults aged 16-24 had self-harmed; young women twice as much as young men (25.7 per cent vs 9.7 per cent). Likewise, at a recent conference, Dudley Youth Health Researchers presented figures from their survey of over a thousand people aged 11-19, and found that almost half (44 per cent) of those surveyed or someone they knew had been affected by self-harm, while 33 per cent had been affected by an eating disorder.

Yet one in five respondents said that they would not know where to seek help or information in these situations. This reflects national statistics. Hospital admissions as a result of self-harm for CYP are on the rise, as are A&E attendances in under 18s with a primary diagnosis of psychiatric condition or intentional self-harm. While these increases may be a good thing – the result of more awareness and more CYP reporting and seeking care – they could also be a signal that CYP don’t know where to turn when they need help early on.

CYP seek help in different ways
Despite the frequent use of the internet and social media, the majority of young people said they would prefer to speak about their health problems face to face – mainly to parents/carers, followed by a doctor and friends. These findings are consistent with those of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey which shows that young people seek help after a suicide attempt in a different way to adults, who were more likely to go to hospital or a specialist service. Therefore the help available has to be based on an understanding of these behaviours and better tailored to the needs of the young.

Surveys have their limitations, but taking their findings together with the nationally available figures is truly worrying. So how do we respond to these challenges?

More funding for CAMHS
One of the biggest barriers to progress in CAMHS identified by an Education Policy Institute (EPI) review was poor staff recruitment, which results in large expenditure on agency staff. Despite the increase in funding to local areas, high agency spending means that any additional funding granted to CAMHS may not ultimately be used for mental health services for CYP at all. 

A greater focus on prevention
However, in spite of funding challenges, there is lots of good work underway that we can learn from. The EPI review provided some excellent recommendations around prevention, early intervention and the need to deliver better treatment. One of the key pillars of early intervention was a stronger focus on health and wellbeing at school and easy access to appropriate care – through drop-ins or self-referral.

More innovative services
There are many passionate professionals, CYP, parents and carers who seem to be getting it right and it is important to celebrate these. For example, the city centre hub called Pause in Birmingham - part of Forward Thinking Birmingham - which plans to revolutionise mental health care for CYP by providing a safe, comfortable and supported space for young people to come, sit, relax and access therapy. Hearing from a young person who is a client of Pause recently made it clear that relatively simple solutions can have a huge impact on people's lives.

Another great example is the Well Centre in Lambeth, a one-stop-shop drop-in centre (with a youth worker, CAMHS nurse and GPs) for young people with any physical or emotional concern. This service demonstrates the importance of youth-friendly, flexible and accessible services for CYP.

The Nuffield Trust also looked at some of the new (and not-so-new) models of care for CYP earlier this year and found that many of them were providing easy and flexible access to high quality care.

A way forward
National Mental Health Day may have been last month, but for a lot of young people, every day is a ‘mental health day’. Without addressing some of the barriers to treatment – and an urgent look at funding – more children and young people may be denied access to lifelines when they need them the most.

But we don’t have to wait for national policy change or additional funding to take action. We all have a collective duty to help the youngest and most vulnerable in our society. New and innovative models like Pause and the one-stop-shop offer hope on the horizon, and the NHS can learn a lot from these services. However, we can all make a contribution to helping our young by making small changes – every contact counts.",0,"Mental","");

(0,"What impact has Covid-19 had on mental health services?","Jenny Davies","Since the emergence of the coronavirus (Covid-19), widespread concern has been raised about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on mental health. We’ve updated our QualityWatch mental health indicators, looking at longer term trends in the quality of NHS mental health care. But what has happened during the pandemic so far, and what does this mean for mental health services in the future?

Symptoms of common mental health conditions increased
The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey asked adults about symptoms of depression between June 2019 and March 2020, and again in June 2020. Between June 2019 and March 2020, 10% of adults were experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of depression. In June 2020, this had almost doubled to 19%.

Self-reported feelings of anxiety spiked in adults at the start of the first lockdown in March. Over the summer, as lockdown measures were eased, anxiety fell but consistently remained at a higher level than in 2019. In October and November, levels of anxiety increased very slightly. While the impact of the second lockdown on mental health remains to be seen, this indicates a worrying picture of worsening mental health.Fewer people were able to access services during the first lockdown
While survey data shows an increase in symptoms of common mental health conditions, during the first lockdown fewer people were referred to mental health services.

Treatment and support for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety is provided by the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. Patients with more significant needs are treated by secondary mental health services.

Between February and April 2020, the number of new referrals to IAPT decreased by 61%. The number of referrals to NHS funded secondary mental health, learning disability and autism services decreased by 39% over the same time period.

This corresponds to a considerable fall in the number of GP appointments and referrals during the first lockdown. It may indicate that fewer patients presented at their GP surgery, or that fewer referrals (including self-referrals in the case of IAPT) were made following GP appointments.The severity of cases seen in secondary mental health services changed
Alongside this decrease in the number of referrals, the caseload of patients accessing secondary care services changed. 43% of psychiatrists surveyed in May reported an increase in urgent and emergency cases and 45% said that routine appointments had decreased.

For patients who were able to access secondary mental health care during the pandemic, the way appointments were carried out changed. Face-to-face appointments were replaced with telephone or video appointments, although most staff surveyed in crisis services reported that home visits were continuing where necessary. This is important as remote appointments are not always appropriate or accessible for the most vulnerable patients.

The change in caseload raises concerns that patients were unable to access support until their condition had worsened. Some patients may have put off seeking support due to worries about using NHS care during the pandemic. For others, the switch to remote appointments may have acted as a barrier to accessing services.

What does this mean for mental health services?
Not everyone who experiences symptoms of a mental health condition will need professional support and treatment. However, the increase in symptoms combined with the fall in GP referrals suggests that mental health services will have to prepare for a future surge in demand.

The drivers of this demand can be split into three groups. Firstly, deferred access to care from people who would have been referred with mental health conditions that pre-date the first lockdown. Secondly, deterioration of symptoms among people with existing mental illness. And finally, from people who have developed mental health conditions due to the wider impacts of the pandemic.

Measures implemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on socialising, limit the availability of informal sources of support, such as from social networks and peer support groups. This could place further pressure on formal services.

Mental health services have been underfunded for many years and were under considerable strain before the pandemic. The recent Spending Review announced a welcome £500 million of funding for mental health to address waiting times, expand support to reach more people, and invest in the workforce. However, estimates suggest that the costs associated with the predicted increase in demand could be as much as an extra £1 billion per year.

The impact of lockdown measures on some of the wider determinants of mental health, such as employment and social isolation, are likely continue for many months. As people’s experience of the pandemic has varied widely, existing inequalities in mental health are likely to be exacerbated. Mental health services may continue to feel the effect of the pandemic for a long time.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Will the third Covid-19 wave overwhelm the NHS?","Sarah Scobie","“Protecting the NHS” has been a mantra for the government throughout the pandemic, as it has sought to get the public on board with adhering to repeated lockdowns and restrictions on everyday life.

Covid restrictions in England have been lifted, but it’s clear that Covid is far from over. Although the most recent data shows a more complex picture, case numbers have been soaring. Despite the impact of the vaccine in reducing severe disease, the numbers of people admitted to hospitals and even Covid deaths are increasing.

What does this mean for the NHS? And will protecting the NHS once again need to become the focus of our pandemic response?

Direct effects of Covid-19 on the NHS
Hospital admissions are the most widely reported measure of the impact of Covid – and these are going up, along with the number of Covid patients in hospital. Covid patients spend a median of seven days in hospital, although this may reduce in this wave as the age of patients admitted is lower. But even so, 38% more beds were occupied by Covid patients on 18 July compared with the previous week, and significant numbers of patients are requiring critical care.The rising number of people in hospital beds is not the only manifestation of rising Covid cases.  Surveillance data from GP practices, 111 services and A&E all show increasing demand on health services from more cases of the virus.

While demand is increasing, there are also pressures on the supply side. Staff absences related to Covid doubled from 6,713 to 13,771 between 1 and 30 June this year. These include people off sick with Covid, but also a substantial number who may be self-isolating or caring for children or other dependants who are isolating. 

While Covid cases are high, hospital and clinic capacity is reduced, even without staff shortages. The demands of social distancing to reduce infections mean there are fewer beds available, and separate treatment areas for Covid and non-Covid patients are needed. And teams need to use additional PPE and cleaning of equipment, so it takes longer to deliver care than before the pandemic.

Further, over a third of people who have had Covid report persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks, sometimes referred to as “Long Covid”. Research into long-term Covid symptoms and effective treatments is ongoing, but there is already evidence that hospitalised Covid patients experience higher mortality and increased chances of readmission than other hospitalised patients. One in three patients were readmitted within 140 days, and one in 10 died after leaving hospital.

Indirect pressures
Rising numbers of Covid cases and the direct pressure this is causing are the very last thing the NHS and social care system needs right now.

The disruption caused during the pandemic has left a massive backlog in people needing treatment, along with a significant upheaval in how patients seek care. 

By May this year the waiting list for planned NHS treatment was 5.3 million, the highest since records began – but numbers treated each week have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. The NHS has been tasked with fully resuming services, but this will be difficult to achieve while Covid rates remain high. As well as the factors noted above, patients waiting for complex surgery that might require admission to intensive care are likely to be particularly impacted. Covid patients typically require longer stays in intensive care than surgical patients, so each additional Covid patient admitted can result in several postponed operations.

The backlog of patients waiting for surgery and investigations is putting pressure on primary care teams, to support these patients and manage ongoing symptoms while they wait for treatment. These same teams are also part of the Covid-19 vaccination programme: over a quarter of the 31.6 million appointments with GPs and practice staff in May this year were to deliver Covid vaccines.

There is also increasing pressure on services in the community, for example, to support people at the end of life. During the pandemic a third more people are dying at home, raising concerns about the capacity of community services to provide care and support for patients and families.

Meanwhile, our social care system is not fit for purpose, and this has a direct impact on people needing social care and support at home to manage health problems. Local authorities are receiving increased numbers of requests for support from people waiting for treatment, or after being discharged after a stay in hospital.

The net result of these demand and supply pressures, combined with a resurgence of other infections as people mix more, is unseasonal levels of demand for urgent treatment. In June this year over 2.1 million people attended A&E, the highest number for any June on record.

Will the NHS be overwhelmed?
The NHS went into the pandemic with fewer doctors, nurses and capital assets than health services in comparable countries, and with deteriorating performance – as measured by growing waiting lists and increased time spent for patients to be seen in A&E.

By the second wave the backlog of people waiting for planned treatment, and how long they had waited, had both increased. The NHS worked to maintain urgent treatment, including cancer, but with nearly 30% of hospital beds occupied by Covid patients, other services were severely impacted.  One ameliorating factor last winter was that lockdown and social distancing measures, along with exceptionally high flu vaccine uptake, prevented the circulation of flu and other seasonal illnesses.  But the NHS workforce emerged from the second wave exhausted.

As the third Covid wave gathers pace, it is clear that the NHS and social care system is in a worse state than at the start of previous waves. Demand for urgent care and the backlog of patients waiting for planned treatment are both growing, staff are exhausted, and non-Covid infections are increasing and likely to get worse over this autumn and winter.

So will the NHS be overwhelmed this time?   

Growing numbers of patients mean Covid wards are already being reopened, and planned operations are being cancelled. If hospital cases continue to rise, as expected given the rapid growth in cases, it will once again result in other services being reduced, in and out of hospital. 

In previous waves, the NHS coped partly because patients deferred seeking help, in response to pleas to “protect the NHS”, and in part because lockdowns reduced some other demands and preserved capacity for Covid patients. But now the public is being told to learn to “live with Covid”. Patients will understandably be less tolerant of delays and worsening quality of care, and in the medium term patient survival for cancer and other conditions could get worse.   

While the NHS will prioritise the most urgent treatment to cope with demand during this Covid wave, this will be at a cost in terms of postponed care and poorer outcomes for many.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Beyond Covid-19 wave two: what now for care homes?","Natasha Curry","One of the most sobering numbers to emerge from the first wave of the pandemic was the number of people residing in care homes in England and Wales to have died of or with Covid-19. Between mid-March and mid-June, there were 19,286 deaths of residents of care homes where the virus was mentioned on the death certificate, accounting for 40% of all Covid deaths registered in that period. As described in our accompanying analysis of the most recent mortality data, this is likely to underestimate the true toll, as there were 35,067 excess deaths (deaths above the ‘expected’ number) of care home residents registered in this same period.

This devastating toll prompted calls for urgent action to be taken to better protect those in care homes ahead of subsequent waves. By mid-September, a winter plan for the social care sector had been published and by late October, the rapidly established social care taskforce had set out no fewer than 52 recommendations for protecting the sector in the next wave.

Why were care homes hit so badly in wave one?
The care sector was already in a fragile state going in to the pandemic and was ill-equipped to cope with the sudden tide of infections. Pre-existing workforce shortages, a vast and precarious provider market, long-standing financial shortfalls, and a lack of robust centralised data about who relies on care created a context in which a response to the virus was difficult to coordinate. These pre-existing fault lines were laid bare during the early months of the pandemic. Gaps in knowledge about the sector were also revealed and still persist (one significant gap being that the impact of Covid on those receiving home care remains largely unmeasured and, particularly for people who fund their own care, currently unmeasurable).

A slow and uncoordinated national response led to delays in PPE supplies reaching care staff and in testing being rolled out. The drive to clear hospital beds in the first weeks failed to take account of the reality of the settings into which many people were being discharged. Patients were not always tested before being discharged, and even when their Covid-19 status was known, the discharge wrongly assumed that care homes had the space, staff and resources to effectively isolate Covid-positive residents.

How have care homes fared in wave two?
As the second wave approached, efforts began to roll out faster testing, to deliver more reliable supplies of PPE and to issue timely and consistent advice to the sector, including reducing staff working across multiple care homes. The extension of the infection control fund to late March 2021 (put in place until September 2020 initially) was welcomed, as was the pledge to supply the sector with PPE free of charge during the same period.

These efforts were not without their challenges, however, with reports of delays in testing and concerns about the practicalities of preventing staff working across settings. Severe restrictions on visits continue to be a source of deep distress to residents and families, and a complex balancing act of different risks for care home managers.

Our accompanying analysis of the most recent mortality data shows that, although there has been a sharp uptick in Covid-19 deaths among care home residents in this second wave, the numbers so far have not reached the scale witnessed in the first wave.

Even with a better testing regime, which is likely to be picking up more cases than was possible in the first wave, deaths from or with the virus among care home residents account for 26% of all Covid-related deaths in the period from 31 October until 5 February. A marked improvement from the 40% of the first wave, but this still represents the devastating loss of over 16,000 individual lives so far. Whether the measures taken prevented an even bigger loss of life, and to what extent other factors such as lower occupancy rates played a part, is impossible to say at this stage and warrants further study.*

What now for care homes?
The news that the first dose of the vaccine has now been offered to all care home residents is a relief, but it is not the time to be complacent. There are still many uncertainties about what impact the vaccine will have among the care home community, particularly in light of recent reports of vaccine hesitancy among staff. What is certain is that the need for vigilant infection control, PPE supplies and continued testing will not disappear any time soon. And while some lessons may have been learnt, care homes face tough times ahead.

Concerns around the financial stability of many care homes were raised before the pandemic, and the increased costs of PPE and staff sickness alongside lower occupancy rates have created extreme financial pressures. Although we haven’t yet seen the predicted widespread closure of providers, there is a risk that some care organisations are only just managing with the increased temporary pandemic support from the government.

Much of this support is set to end on 31 March and it is crucial that the care sector isn’t faced with a cliff-edge. The last thing users of care need after a traumatic year is to suffer the distress and disruption of their care home closing. Councils, providers, staff, residents and their families need certainty about what will happen come April.

Beyond that, as we begin to emerge from this pandemic, there is an opportunity to build something positive from the devastation of the last year by building a more sustainable and resilient care system, fit for the 21st century and better able to weather future storms.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Safe delivery? The main challenges for the NHS in delivering the Covid-19 vaccine","Helen Buckingham","From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world waited with bated breath for news of a protective vaccine. In the end, much like the proverbial buses, when one came along, others followed in rapid succession. Vaccines from both Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca have been licensed for use in the UK, and vaccinations are well underway. The Moderna vaccine has also now been given the green light, although it will still be a few months before it’s available for use. The NHS plans to vaccinate a significant part of the population before Easter.

But what are the challenges for the health service as it delivers the biggest mass vaccination project in its history?

The hurdles ahead
First, there is the logistical challenge. It will be no mean feat to get the right staff in the right place at the right time with the supplies they need, while ensuring that the people they need to vaccinate are also in the same place at the same time.

There are three competing demands on NHS staff. The need to respond to the very considerable pressures caused by Covid itself, the need to keep ‘normal’ NHS services operating as much as possible (including treating the backlog of patients that has built up), and now the need to deliver the vaccination programme. NHS England have acknowledged that these demands cannot be met solely by the existing workforce.

It has been the responsibility of NHS organisations and GP practices to identify premises to deliver the vaccinations. They need to be easy to reach by both staff and the public – and not already being used by the Test and Trace service. They also need to be big enough for everyone to maintain social distancing throughout, while providing storage for the vaccines themselves and also the PPE and other consumables required. As of January 22, vaccinations in England were being delivered from almost 240 hospital sites and over 1,100 community locations, from pharmacies to mass vaccination centres.

A national distribution service has been established to ensure that every site delivering vaccinations receives supplies of the necessary vaccines, consumables and PPE, seven days a week.

While it does feel appropriate that such logistics are coordinated centrally, we must hope that lessons have been learned from the challenges of PPE distribution during the first wave. In these first few weeks of the programme, it does appear that supply of the vaccine at a local level is the main limiting factor for local delivery. There is no evidence as yet of any Brexit-related disruption to imports from Europe impacting the vaccine supply chain, although Pfizer has announced a temporary slow-down in production while their factories are reconfigured.

The Pfizer vaccine also needs to be stored at a temperature of at least -70°C until shortly before use, presenting an additional challenge. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less problematic from this point of view, but there are other challenges to the supply chain. A worldwide shortage of the glass vials in which the vaccine is delivered to sites is one rate-limiting factor to distribution, and a second is the requirement for each individual batch to be assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The latter issue is being addressed by the MHRA, but the former is likely to be problematic for some time. 

Getting the message right
The speed of the vaccines’ development has been truly impressive – no vaccine has ever before progressed from the starting blocks to licensing for use within a year.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it appears that throwing vast sums of money and the best expertise in the world at a problem is one way to find a rapid solution. And regulators have worked hard to ensure that they can carry out their safety checks through a ‘rolling review’ process, running in parallel with the clinical trials.

The vaccines’ developers and regulators have given welcome reassurance that no corners were cut around safety in the race to get a vaccine ready. Nonetheless, there is still a significant communications challenge for the NHS to ensure the public are confident to come forward and be vaccinated. Communications leads working at both local and national level have a critical role to play working alongside their clinical colleagues – including in reassuring the public if there is an incident of an adverse reaction to the vaccine.

The MHRA have specific arrangements in place to track any such incidents, with an anticipated incidence of 0.05-0.1%. Because the Covid vaccines will be administered on a large scale, there may well be instances of people who get ill at the same time as having the injection, which may not have a relationship with the actual vaccination.

In fact, within 24 hours of the first Pfizer vaccines being administered, ‘yellow card’ reports were received indicating two serious allergic reactions. Fortunately, communications teams were able to work well with the media to keep these individual incidents in context, and although standard operating procedures were revised, they do not appear to have undermined public confidence in the vaccine programme.

However, there are concerns about the level of uptake of the vaccine among people from ethnic minorities, who appear to be at greater risk of poor outcomes from Covid infections. It is now a requirement to record the ethnicity of those vaccinated, so that any trends and disparities are rapidly identified. Given the concern surrounding the apparent risks for people from BAME communities, it is hard to see why this requirement was not in place from the start of the programme. NHS England is working closely with community leaders to ensure confidence in the vaccination programme, including designating facilities such as mosques as vaccination centres.

A return towards normality?
Many questions have been asked about who will be vaccinated, and when. The Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisations published the priority order for receipt of the Pfizer vaccine in early December, and this was reconfirmed on the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine later in the month.

Most invitations to NHS staff and members of the public are being coordinated locally via NHS employers and GP practices, but a national booking system has also been put in place to support the mass vaccination centres. When called for their vaccination, people are able to make an appointment at a GP practice, a community pharmacy or one of the mass vaccination centres. For people unable to travel, ‘roving teams’ bring the vaccine to them. A second national system has also been established to hold data on who has received the vaccine (the Pinnacle system), which crucially will help to ensure that people receive both doses needed to confer the maximum possible immunity.

It will be critical that information flows smoothly between the national system and local services. Any glitches will impact not only on public confidence, but on the confidence of the health care professionals relied upon to reassure the public. Unfortunately in the early stages of the rollout, the Pinnacle system has experienced system problems, and GP practices have been recording data manually. We must hope that these issues can be addressed rapidly.

The last 10 months have been some of the most difficult the NHS has ever experienced, and it’s also been an extraordinarily tough year for the public. The next few months will not be easy either. But a successful vaccination programme will mean we can all look forward to a return to normality during 2021, and to the human contact that so many people have so desperately missed.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Children and young people’s emergency care during Covid-19: what have we learned?","Dr Elizabeth Fisher","Well before the emergence of Covid-19, an area of interest to us at the Nuffield Trust has been the use of emergency hospital care among children and young people – with suggestions they are more likely to attend A&E “inappropriately” than is the case for other age groups.

In this blog, I look at the patterns of children and young people’s A&E use before and during the pandemic, and discuss what they might tell us about the subject more widely.

Children and young people’s A&E attendances before and during the pandemic
Recent analysis by the Strategy Unit shows significant falls in A&E attendances by people aged 19 and under since Covid-19 started (see chart below).Yet over the same period, there seemingly have not been large-scale or immediate serious consequences – such as significant increases in children going to A&E too late or increased mortality in under 14s. It’s tempting therefore to conclude that, before March, too many parents and young adults might have been using A&E “inappropriately”.

But by how much are those “inappropriate” A&E attendances down since the pandemic started? One way to find out is to look at attendances where nothing abnormal was detected, compared to those that brought a diagnosis of an injury or illness. It reveals that, during the initial stages of the pandemic, A&E attendances where this was recorded dropped to about a third of their normal levels.

However, the same data shows it wasn’t just potentially inappropriate A&E attendances affected – those bringing a diagnosis of a health care problem also went down by the same scale.

Furthermore, A&E attendances by children and young people in 2019 where nothing abnormal was detected accounted for only 7% of all attendances. That is in comparison to 90% of attendances where a problem was diagnosed – indicating that the majority of attendances were for real issues.

Yet that doesn’t tell us whether those issues were significant enough to warrant emergency care, or whether they could have been reasonably dealt with by other forms of care, such as those provided by GP practices and in the community.

One way to determine that would be to look at A&E attendances defined as non-urgent (cases that are not true accidents or emergencies) or standard (cases without immediate danger or distress) – see chart below.This shows that attendances at A&E for less serious cases did drop during the early stages of the pandemic.

But if you also look at A&E attendances deemed to be serious (i.e. urgent or requiring immediate treatment for preservation of life), the decreases are of a similar scale – indicating again it’s not just “inappropriate” care affected.

Attendance rates for clear-cut emergencies – where it will be more obvious to everyone that treatment in A&E is needed – dropped to a lesser degree and have returned to normal levels quicker. Attendances for burns and scalds, for example, did not drop as much during lockdown, and have since returned to the numbers seen last year.

What does this tell us?
Some of the drops in A&E attendances during the pandemic will be due to lockdown and social distancing measures having a beneficial impact on a child or young person’s health – such as respiratory conditions being helped by less road traffic, or school closures meaning viral or bacterial infections haven’t circulated as freely. But that is unlikely to be the full story.

The fact that attendances dropped prior to lockdown, coupled with decreases in attendances for more ‘appropriate’ cases, suggests that parents and individuals also balanced the risks of Covid-19 against other health care risks, while paying heed to widely used messages about “protecting the NHS”.

Unanswered questions
The fact that it’s been a different story for clear-cut emergencies might on one hand not be surprising, but it does pose some interesting questions.

Does it mean that in less clear-cut circumstances, parents and individuals have been more willing to just put up with certain aliments and illnesses and not seek emergency care at all? Were they more comfortable in monitoring conditions rather than seek care, until it became clearer that emergency care was essential or not?

Or were they able to seek other forms of care, without the need to use emergency care?

Unfortunately, we do not know enough about out-of-hospital care to know whether this happened. The recent policy focus for children and young people’s health care services has been on boosting that out-of-hospital care, with a push to age-appropriate care closer to home. It shifts the focus away from A&E on its own, with any reductions in attendances just a benefit of the new focus and one measure of its success.

The past few months, however, offer a unique opportunity to inform the implementation of that policy, as well as the longer-term changes for children and young people’s services outlined in it. Knowing more about what has happened could also have a beneficial impact on new policies such as “call before you walk”, which discourages people attending A&E without an appointment.

If we could determine what parents and young people chose to do during this pandemic rather than access emergency care – while also finding out what they thought about the alternatives, alongside their views on the future service they want – it could help to inform the NHS’s short and longer-term recovery from Covid-19.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Recovering from Covid-19: the international picture","Sarah Reed","We have seen distressing headlines about how Covid-19 has disrupted core NHS services. Has this been the experience of other countries?
The NHS has certainly not been alone in having to make difficult trade-offs and redirect resources in response to the pandemic.

Even the most well-equipped health systems have postponed or cancelled services that are less urgent – to free up capacity for surges in Covid-19 cases and to help keep rates of transmission as low as possible. Germany and the Netherlands, for instance, both went into the pandemic with more doctors, nurses and hospital beds than the UK, and have had less severe outbreaks of the virus, but still deferred elective care during the peak months of the crisis.

Although essential services have been maintained in many health systems, some countries have seen similarly worrying trends of people forgoing care as in the UK – raising concerns more globally about unmet need and the non-Covid health consequences of the pandemic. For example, experts in Germany, Belgium and Sweden have all reported drops in those countries in the numbers of patients presenting to emergency departments or receiving other critical services during the peak Covid period.

This has serious implications for people living with ongoing health conditions and for recovery in each country, and will add to the backlog of issues that health systems will have to address in the pandemic’s wake.

But of course, countries also entered this crisis with very different starting points, and have been impacted by the virus in different ways. It’s those differences that are likely to play out in system recovery – and influence how effectively and quickly health systems are able to resume care for everyone who needs it.

What might the NHS’s path to recovery look like compared to other health systems?
Despite the NHS pursuing many similar strategies to other countries in increasing capacity and in restarting elective care, it is likely to have a slower path to recovery given where it was at the start of the pandemic.

Even if the NHS had responded perfectly to contain and manage Covid-19, it’s plausible to say that recovery would have always been a challenge given the existing pressures on the health service.

The UK met Covid-19 with higher bed occupancy rates and fewer doctors, nurses and capital resources than most other health systems. Parts of the NHS have been working with older buildings and equipment, chronic workforce shortages, and very little slack to scale up activity in a crisis. This is different than in countries like Germany, which has three times as many beds and nearly twice as many nurses per person.

How many resources each country’s health system had at the start of the pandemic will be important when we consider the impact of infection control measures that the NHS and other health systems will now have to implement. Every country severely affected by the coronavirus will be challenged to deliver what it could do previously.

But those capacity concerns in the UK could mean it is more stretched than other countries in addressing the demand that’s built up over the pandemic – which could mean longer waiting times and have devastating consequences for some patients.  

What else might influence how well a system recovers?
The amount of beds, equipment and staff in each health system is only one determinant in system recovery. A host of other factors – many of which are harder to quantify – will also be key to understanding how resilient health systems have been.

These include practical things like testing and tracing capabilities, and availability of personal protective equipment. But they also include how well countries are able to coordinate and make effective decisions across different levels of government and sectors. Other factors, such as how well health systems are able to adapt and maintain any positive changes developed in response to the pandemic, will also matter.

The recovery of health systems will also not happen in a vacuum. Given the way the health and socioeconomic crises of the pandemic are converging, wider government responses to the pandemic will also be critical.

What are some common ways that health systems have built capacity to respond to Covid-19?
Even countries entering the pandemic with relatively greater capacity, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have had to find ways to increase staff and release acute and critical care beds and equipment to treat patients severely affected by the virus.

To quickly mobilise the workforce, a number of countries called upon the help of inactive health care personnel, as well as students close to graduation from medical, nursing and public health programmes. Countries also stretched their existing workforce by moving more staff from part-time to full-time roles, modifying work schedules, and upskilling staff into new roles. Such efforts have also been supported by simplifying registration and hiring processes.

To free up more acute care resources, common approaches have included converting existing wards and theatres into intensive care units, building temporary field hospitals or treatments centres in the community to help triage and manage cases, and adding resources from the private sector.

This all required rapid changes to how care is organised and delivered. It is critical that we learn what’s been positive about some of the system changes, and maintain them for the future.

Where have there been key differences?
A large number of health systems have created designated treatment or diagnostic centres as ‘Covid-19 only’ to further reduce transmission, but countries differ in their feasibility and need to do so.

In countries where this hasn’t happened, health centres have been reconfigured to make it possible to isolate potential cases into separate ‘zones’ or ‘circuits’, and prevent staff from working across different pathways to reduce exposure.

This is happening in Spain, where elective surgery is only being resumed in hospitals where Covid patients make up 5% of total capacity. There providers are also doing things like restructuring appointments, so that all pre-surgery assessments happen remotely or on the same day to avoid multiple visits.

A smaller number of countries have also found capacity by redistributing resources regionally to areas less overwhelmed by Covid-19. This has happened in France, Spain and Italy, where staff or patients were moved to redistribute capacity more evenly throughout their respective health systems. Doing so has been less practical in countries like the UK, where the virus has spread more widely across regions and localities.

Another key difference has been around staff pay. Covid-19 prompted a handful of countries (such as Germany, France and Canada) to increase wages or provide bonus payments to key health and care workers, particularly those in lower paid roles or those working in high-risk environments.

In many cases those uplifts were temporary, and only applied to the peak Covid months.

What are some of the main considerations for countries as they reopen services?  
Health systems are all in very different stages of resuming services, but there are some common decisions that many countries have to face. They include how best to manage infection control, which services to prioritise, and how much reserve capacity to maintain in the event of future outbreaks.

Countries have varied in their approach, and again the choices they make will in part be influenced by their existing resources going into the pandemic.

Reconfiguring health care facilities to reduce transmission and build in greater slack will place constraints on what health systems can deliver. The NHS entered the crisis with real pressures that are unlikely to go away any time soon, even with the recent £3 billion funding announcement.

The key thing is getting patients back through the system as quickly and as safely as they can, but as long as the NHS has to remain Covid-19 resilient then access will be reduced and people will unfortunately be left waiting longer.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Covid-19: how is it impacting on prisoners’ health?","Dr Miranda Davies","In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were serious concerns that without intervention it would spread rapidly in prisons. Modelling estimations by Public Health England made available in late April suggested that, without action, there could be as many as 77,800 cases and 2,700 deaths from a prison population of around 81,000. The prison estate consequently implemented its own version of lockdown – which most notably meant the majority of prisoners remaining locked in their cells for at least 23 hours a day.

The prison estate has not yet seen the numbers of cases that were initially feared. Up to June 15th, there have been 502 confirmed positive cases of prisoners with Covid-19, with 971 staff also testing positive. 23 prisoners and 9 staff are reported to have died as a result of the virus.

As in the wider population, the actual numbers of cases are likely to be much higher than those identified through formal testing. PHE estimated 1,385 ‘possible/probable cases’ based on confirmed numbers within prisons, but the numbers are still significantly less than the worst-case scenario.

With a framework now in place outlining the plans to ease lockdown restrictions in prisons, we consider here the future for people in prison while Covid-19 remains a threat, as well as the impact on access to health care. 

Ongoing management of Covid-19 in prisons
Life for people in prison is currently severely restricted. As well as having to spend more hours in their cells, Covid-19 has meant that education and most employment have been all but halted, and there are no face-to-face family visits taking place.

Measures have also been introduced to reduce the flow and spread of new cases into prisons. That is challenging from the outset, however, as there isn’t space to put everyone in single cell accommodation. At some prisons, temporary cells have been added outside in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on existing cell space. 

Many of the current restrictions will remain to a greater or lesser extent while Covid-19 is in general circulation, and will exacerbate the challenges in prisons caused by outdated facilities and overcrowded conditions.

Scrutiny visits by HM Inspectorate of Prisons during the pandemic have highlighted the difficulties of following public health guidance in prisons – and where conditions are not what we might expect in 2020. A visit to three category C training prisons, for instance, noted that at one prison – Coldingley – people were having to use buckets in their cells as toilets at night, as the cells did not have built-in sanitation. They otherwise had to wait to be let out to go to communal toilets, which could take up to two hours.

Management of the virus also needs to be considered alongside the mental and physical health impact on prisoners. Prior to Covid-19, self-harm rates in prison were high, and increasing. There were over 63,000 incidents of self-harm in 2019, which was a rise of 14% on the previous year. Self-harm rates have been a point of concern in HMIP scrutiny visits – with higher levels now than before the pandemic.

The impact on prisoners of having very little time outside their cells, and little or no meaningful contact with others, cannot be understated. As a possible sign of the pressure that restrictions have had, in May there were five suicides in prisons over a six-day period.

The impact of Covid-19 on prisoners’ access to health care
Even under ‘normal’ circumstances, prisoners face poorer access to hospital services than the general population do. In 2017/18, prisoners had 24% fewer inpatient admissions and outpatient attendances than the equivalent age and sex demographic in the wider population, and 45% fewer attendances at A&E departments.

While Covid-19 remains a threat, access is likely to be further restricted. That raises concerns about both unmet need and a further widening of the gap between how often and why prisoners and those in the general population access services.   

Access to hospital services for prisoners is dependent on initial triage in prison. With most prisoners only out of their cells for short periods each day, being physically seen by health care staff in prison is likely to be more difficult.

Demand for limited access to secondary health care will also increase, as people may need to go to hospital due to symptoms of Covid-19. However, prisons will still need to manage the care needs of patients who require unavoidable hospital care, such as dialysis. That means the threshold (how sick people need to be) to go to hospital will invariably increase.

Crucially, staff also need to be available to escort prisoners to hospital. Some staff will have Covid-19 themselves or be self-isolating, and this may affect escort capacity.

Maintaining social distancing in prison means everyday tasks take longer, as people can only be let out of their cells in small groups. Staff are more stretched to maintain even a basic regime where people can shower or make a phone call. That cumulatively means fewer staff being available and more to physically do for the staff who are there. 

Easing lockdown in prisons
The framework criteria that have to be met in order to ease restrictions in prisons make it clear that change is likely to be slow and that there will be local-level variation.

This inherent flexibility, alongside very little publicly available information about what is happening in prisons, means it would be very easy for the status quo to be maintained.

In reality, conditions in some prisons were poor before the coronavirus and there is therefore a real risk that managing Covid-19 becomes an excuse to do nothing.

Over the coming months it is crucial that, alongside stopping the spread of the virus in the prison population, there is a concerted effort to understand and publicly report on the impact of regime changes on the lives of people living and working in prison. Prisoners and their families, as well as those working in prisons, should not be forgotten.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Reducing avoidable harms to children during Covid-19: what actions are needed?","Dr Charlotte Paddison","This week doctors have been alerted to watch out for a rare but very serious new illness among children. The numbers affected appear to be very small, and research is underway to determine whether or not it is linked to Covid-19. Most children catching the coronavirus thankfully recover in full without any serious health effects.

Yet with concern that children are among those who could become ‘collateral damage’ from the crisis, what actions could be taken now to make a difference to protect the youngest members in society from avoidable harms?

Better identification
One of the first things that is needed is an enhanced process for identifying very vulnerable children that require the highest measures of social protection – known as ‘shielding’. Thousands of people appear to have been missed off the government’s ‘high risk’ list for the virus, which could mean children too.

Personal communication from one community paediatric team found that only a small proportion – approximately 1 in 4 children – identified as needing shielding via clinical review had received a letter formally recommending such measures. Doctors there had reviewed a list of seriously ill children under their care to identify those where shielding was clinically indicated based on the child’s health conditions, and found many children who appeared to have been missed.

So what might help? The current approach could be usefully supported by a rapid review by paediatricians of children under their care or, where that is not practical, automated searches of GP records for children with multiple or complex health conditions. 

Keeping vulnerable children safe
Protecting the most vulnerable children – including looked-after children, disabled children and young carers – must continue to be seen as a policy priority. With calls to the National Domestic Abuse hotline up by a worrying 25% since the lockdown started, children on ‘at risk’ registers are an important group to focus upon.

That means protecting the staffing of children’s services – including mental health and social services – so that those essential to protecting children’s health continue to be available. CAMHS referrals in some areas are being declined because of the virus, and where professional support is available to young carers or children with mental health problems, for now it is mainly limited to phone calls. 

With families and children’s services creaking under increasing strain, one solution might be an army of volunteers for vulnerable kids, as suggested by the Children’s Commissioner. They might be people who are able to help social services and schools reach children and families, check in on what is going on, while offering support to those families.

Avoiding delays in diagnosis
It is vital that parents with a seriously ill child know how they can get help. Seeing a doctor at a GP practice is generally the first port of call for parents with an ill child, but this route of access has changed beyond all recognition. NHS England has instructed practitioners to do remote consultations “as a default”, with GPs reportedly seeing only seven in every 100 patients in person. 

It is hard to downplay the clinical value of physically seeing a really sick child, and we must find a way to provide fast access to ‘face-to-face’ medicine where it is still needed. Key here is to communicate that practices are still open, with GPs keen to stress they are safe to visit. With clinical commissioning groups increasingly concerned that people are not coming to seek care from GP practices when it is urgently needed, more effort may be needed to ensure this message is clear.

Parents also need to know that, in most cases, the benefits for a seriously sick child of going to A&E are likely to outweigh the risks of exposure to Covid-19.    

An intelligent plan
While services for life-threatening conditions such as childhood leukaemia are rightly being prioritised, a growing volume of ‘sub-acute’ work for children with serious long-term conditions is being put on ice. 

This includes delays in blood tests needed to monitor disease flares and medication-related harms among children with autoimmune conditions, cuts to physiotherapy for children with physical disabilities, and delays in the treatment of bacterial lung infections among children with cystic fibrosis. Many services for chronically ill children have been drastically reduced or temporarily cut altogether, which may go on for some months. 

Clinical teams will now need to develop an intelligent plan for catching up on the work that has fallen on the back burner. 

With many hospitals now unexpectedly quiet after mothballing normal operations in preparation for the coronavirus, there is an urgent need to develop streams of work that benefit patients but which are not associated with increased clinical risk due to Covid-19 infection. And which can be flexibly stepped up during quiet spells and switched off if Covid-19 patient numbers increase.

That could include clinical audits, review and triage of incoming referrals, taking histories from new patients via phone or video and identifying those needing immediate priority action – desk-based tasks that mean when clinical work properly resumes it can do so as quickly and efficiently as possible.

A coordinated effort is also needed across specialities working with children to set priorities for post-Covid recovery, and make sure that in the rush to catch up, the focus is on resuming services and interventions that make the biggest difference to improving and protecting children’s health.

Acting now to protect children from avoidable harms
There have been rapid service innovations (particularly in primary care) that, together with delays and reduced access to children’s services, not only bring a range of future opportunities for more focused and nimble working but also risks, unintended consequences and potential harms.  

Some of these harms will be avoidable, and can be mitigated by actions taken now to identify vulnerable children, keep essential services in place, avoid delays in diagnosis, and make an intelligent plan for catching up in the months ahead.",0,"Covid","");

(0,"Safety in health and social care","Jessica Morris","The NHS is aspiring to be “one of the safest healthcare systems in the world”. But healthcare is a high-risk activity, and improving safety requires us to address the environment in which care is delivered, and to look beyond individual incidents or mistakes. An open and transparent safety culture is needed, where staff are encouraged to report risks and incidents, and action is taken to learn from them and ensure they do not reoccur.

Measuring how the safety of healthcare is changing over time is challenging and complex. There is more information available about harm to patients than there is about whether or not services are safe. Further to this, adverse events and near-misses tend to be under-reported, so an increased reporting of such events may reflect an improved awareness of safety issues rather than a less safe environment. And safety in healthcare is a moving target – as standards improve we come to regard an increasing number of events as patient safety issues, for example, the increased focus on healthcare-associated infections in recent years.

Here at QualityWatch, we’ve reviewed and updated our indicators looking at how the safety of NHS care has changed over time. Although there are some gaps in the data, due to limited information in areas such as primary care and community settings, we have been able to identify indicators at a national level across many aspects of safety. While some measures show an improvement, such as the management of venous thromboembolism and hospital cleanliness, other measures, such as the proportion of hip fracture cases that have prompt surgery, have not improved. Please find below a summary of our safety indicators, and click on the links for more content and analysis.

Safety culture
View the indicator

A good safety culture in healthcare is one where staff have positive perceptions of psychological safety, teamwork and leadership, and feel comfortable discussing errors.
The proportion of NHS Staff Survey respondents who “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that when errors, near misses or incidents are reported their organisation takes action to ensure that they do not happen again increased slightly from 67% in 2015 to 69% in 2017.
NHS staff working in Acute Specialist Trusts report that their organisation takes the most action to ensure that incidents do not happen again, and Ambulance Trust staff report that their organisation takes the least action.
In 2017, seven out of ten NHS Staff Survey respondents “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that they would feel secure raising concerns about unsafe clinical practice, up from 68% in 2014.
General managers, nurses and midwives, and medical/dental consultants feel more secure raising concerns than medical/dental trainees and ambulance staff.
Are patients told about medication side effects?
View the indicator

Effective communication to patients of medication and side effects to watch for is an important aspect of patient safety.
Less than half of survey respondents said that they were “completely” told about medication side effects to watch for. Over a third of survey respondents were not told about side effects to watch for.
Between 2009 and 2017, the proportion of Adult Inpatient Survey respondents who were “completely” or “to some extent” told about medication side effects to watch for increased from 54% to 57%.
Hospital cleanliness
View the indicator

Across the NHS, cleanliness is a vital part of ensuring safe, high-quality care. Failure to meet the required standards could lead to the spread of infections, ward closures and potentially impact the health of patients and staff.
The proportion of Adult Inpatient Survey respondents who said that their room or ward was “very clean” increased from 63% in 2009 to 70% in 2017.
Healthcare-associated infections
View the indicator

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are bacterial infections which commonly occur as a direct result of healthcare interventions, or from being in contact with a healthcare setting.
In 2007, the levels of C. difficile and MRSA became a major national concern, and action to address these problems was far reaching. Between 2007 and 2014, there was a 76% reduction in C. difficile cases and an 81% reduction in MRSA cases. Since then, the annual counts of these bacterial infections has fluctuated.
Enhanced surveillance of E. coli has been mandatory for NHS acute trusts since 2011. Between 2012 and 2017, the total number of E. coli infections increased by 27%, prompting the launch of a government initiative to reduce Gram-negative bloodstream infections. However, some of the increase may reflect higher rates of blood culture testing as awareness of sepsis has increased.
Injuries due to falls
View the indicator

Patients in hospital should receive the help and support they need to prevent falls and injuries such as hip fractures. And all patients with a hip fracture should be operated on promptly, to improve the outcome.
In England, the percentage of hip fractures that happened in hospital (rather than in homes, care homes and outside) decreased from 4.9% in March 2012 to 3.7% in September 2018. The proportion is higher in Wales but lower in Northern Ireland.
The percentage of hip fractures cases having prompt surgery (within 36 hours) is higher in winter than summer, and has been declining over time in England since 2014. On average, 75% of hip fracture patients in England have surgery within 36 hours, compared with 63% of patients in Wales and only 25% of patients in Northern Ireland.
Venous thromboembolism
View the indicator

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious medical condition which can affect patients after surgery or other medical care.
Since 2010/11, there has been an increase in the proportion of adult inpatients whose risk of VTE was assessed. The 95% target was introduced in 2013/14 as part of the national VTE CQUIN goal, and the 95% threshold has been exceeded since 2013/14 Q1.
Between 2007 and 2016, the rate of patients who were admitted to hospital with any cause and died within 90 days of their last discharge from a VTE related event decreased from 72 to 62 deaths per 100,000 adult hospital admissions.
Emergency readmissions
View the indicator

Between 2010/11 and 2016/17, the number of 30-day emergency readmissions to hospital in England increased by 19%, and the emergency readmissions rate increased from 7.5% to 8%.
Patients who are readmitted to hospital with pressure sores or VTE, when these conditions were not diagnosed in their previous admission, may have received suboptimal care. The emergency readmissions rate for pressure sores increased from 0.05% of admissions in 2010/11 to 0.13% of admissions in 2016/17. The emergency readmissions rate for VTE increased from 0.11% to 0.13% over the same time period.
Suicide in mental health service users
View the indicator

Suicides by people in contact with mental health services are arguably the most preventable. In the UK, there were 1,612 suicides by people who had been in contact with mental health services in the previous 12 months in 2016. This accounts for 27% of all suicides in the general population.
Between 2006 and 2016, the number of suicides by people in contact with mental health services in the UK increased by 11%. However, this is overshadowed by a substantial decrease in the rate of patient suicide, when you take account of the rising number of people receiving mental health care.
Social care users and safety
View the indicator

The Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS) asks service users if care and support services help them in feeling safe. Between 2014-15 and 2017-18, the proportion of services users who responded “Yes” they do help them in feeling safe increased slightly from 85% to 86%.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Our response to new guidance on alcohol consumption","Anonymous","Researchers at the Nuffield Trust health think tank published a report on 22nd December which showed the extent of the challenge to the NHS posed by harmful drinking. Commenting on the new guidance on alcohol consumption from the Chief Medical Officer today, report author Dr Alisha Davies said:

“The CMO’s evidence based guidelines for alcohol consumption are welcome, given the rising demands alcohol related harm is placing on health services and wider society. Our research before Christmas found worrying trends in attendances and admissions to hospital specific to alcohol. The rate at which people are entering NHS wards for reasons specific to alcohol has gone up by over 50% in the past nine years.

The number of admissions now tops a quarter of a million a year. We also found those with alcohol related liver disease tended to be associated with higher hospital use for up to five years before diagnosis, underlining how this condition can come from a person’s health deteriorating in a way that could be preventable. These statistics, however, are at the extreme end of harmful drinking, and only represent the tip of the iceberg. 

“The CMO’s clear message is that drinking any alcohol can have harmful effects on health. It’s not always an easy message, but people who drink really do need to watch their intake carefully”.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"UK young people let down on long-term illness, new international report finds","Anonymous","Young people in the UK are making healthier life choices for themselves than before, but are more likely to die from asthma or have a poor quality of life from long-term conditions compared to counterparts in other high-income countries.

This is according to the first ever international comparison of young people’s health measures over time, comparing the UK to 18 other high-income countries, published today by the Nuffield Trust and the Association for Young People’s Health [AYPH].

The report, written by paediatricians and researchers at the Nuffield Trust and AYPH, is based on analysis of 17 measures of the health and wellbeing of young people, aged 10-24, between the mid-1990s and the last year for which data are comparable. The indicators examined by the authors include long-standing illnesses; alcohol consumption; cancer mortality; obesity and deprivation.

The UK sits in the bottom third of the comparative countries in nine out of 17 indicators, and in the top third in three. In four out of 17 indicators, trends over time have been getting worse, and in five areas previous improvements have stalled.  

Key findings from the report conclude that:

The UK has the highest rate of deaths from asthma for young people aged 10-24, compared to all European countries in the comparator group, and the fourth highest overall behind the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The asthma mortality rate in the UK was approximately twice as high as that of the next worst country in Europe, and any improvements made have started to stall in the last few years.
Nearly one in five young people in the UK are estimated to be living with a long-standing health condition, and the UK is one of the worst countries for young people to suffer from years lost to ill health and the burden of their diseases like diabetes.
As well as having the highest rates of obesity in 15 to 19-year-olds compared to the 14 European countries, the UK also has one of the greatest differences in obesity levels between young people living in the poorest areas of the country and the richest.
The UK is in the middle of the pack compared to other countries on some indicators for young people, including cancer mortality, smoking, alcohol consumption and cannabis use. Trends in health-related behaviours like smoking and alcohol consumption have been improving in recent years, with falls in smoking rates and use of cannabis.
The UK has some of the lowest rates of road traffic injury deaths, which have also been steadily improving over time. Authors put this down to a concerted effort from industry and government to make both cars and roads safer.
On the whole, the UK performs in the top third of countries on mortality rates for 10 to 19-year-olds. Recently, however, progress has stalled and for young people aged 20-24 got worse between 2013 and 2016.
The report calls into question whether health services are adequately helping young people to manage their long-term conditions. For example, a National Paediatric Diabetes Audit for 2016–17 reported that only 43.6% of those aged over 12 received all seven key health care checks during the previous year of care.

These findings are made in the context of 20 to 24-year-olds in the UK having the third highest levels of material deprivation in Europe (behind Greece and Italy), which the authors argue is having a knock-on effect on all other indicators. The report warns that the government and senior health leaders should look at these findings with real foreboding: inequalities must be closed and cuts to public health budgets addressed if they are serious about reversing these worrying trends.

Nigel Edwards, Chief Executive of the Nuffield Trust said:

“Making sure we have a healthy population requires us all to do our bit. More than ever, young people are holding up their side of the bargain, with more of them choosing to smoke and drink less, yet our health system seems to be getting something badly wrong. I worry this reflects a dangerous complacency. 

“Young people in the UK are entering adulthood with more long-term health conditions and as a result a poorer quality of life, storing up problems further down the line. If we don’t take action now, the next generation will be entering adulthood sicker than the one before it.”

Emma Rigby, Chief Executive at the Association for Young People’s Health said:

“The crucial thing to note here is how important long-term health conditions are in the 10-24 age group. We need more understanding of young people’s health needs, improved support for young people to understand and manage their own health, and we need to provide more youth friendly health services. This will help improve our standing internationally in terms of youth health outcomes.”

Baroness Doreen Massey of Darwen, Patron of the Association for Young People’s Health and Chair of All Party Parliamentary Group for Young People’s Health said:

“This comprehensive report is a wake-up call to improve health services for our young people and is a timely inspiration in the wake of the new NHS Long Term Plan. Investment in young people aged 10 to 24 is urgently needed in order to have healthy adults in the future.

“It is encouraging to see that young people are taking the initiative to have healthier lives in some areas, but policy initiatives and youth friendly services are needed, coupled with more action to tackle determinants of health including deprivation, inequality and young people not in education, employment and training.”",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Cancer","Jenny Davies","Cancer services were under increasing pressure even before the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The headline target that 85% of patients should start a first treatment for cancer within two months of an urgent GP referral has not been met since 2015, and while cancer survival rates in the UK are improving, they still lag behind in international comparisons.

Despite efforts to maintain cancer treatment during the pandemic, there has been a significant impact on services. Referrals and first consultant appointments for suspected cancer fell, while emergency presentations increased. Cancellations to treatment for cancer were also reported. New guidance published in March 2021 outlines plans to fully restore cancer services, including meeting the increased level of referrals and treatment required to address the fall in first treatments for cancer by March 2022. Activity is recovering to near normal levels, but a considerable backlog of patients waiting for diagnosis or treatment remains.

With almost four in 10 cases of cancer linked to known risk factors, we’ve looked at trends in smoking, alcohol use, and obesity. We’ve also updated our indicators looking at the quality of care along the cancer pathway, including screening, diagnosis and treatment, as well as survival and mortality rates.

Smoking
See the indicator>>

The percentage of people using NHS Stop Smoking Services who self-reported that they were successful in quitting at four weeks remained relatively steady between 2007/08 and 2019/20, at around 50%. In Q1 and Q2 2020/21 (April to September 2020), following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it increased to 58%.
The number of people using NHS Stop Smoking Services who set a quit date has fallen for eight consecutive years, from 816,444 in 2011/12 to 221,678 in 2019/20.
Alcohol-related harm and drinking behaviour
See the indicator>>

In England, the alcohol-related deaths rate has remained roughly constant over time, fluctuating between a high of 48 deaths per 100,000 population in 2008 and a low of 46 deaths per 100,000 population in 2014.
According to the Health Survey for England, between 2006 and 2019 heavy drinking fell for people aged 16 to 54 years old, but increased for people aged 65 and over.
Between 2006 and 2019, there has been a large decrease in the percentage of 8 to 15-year-olds who reported that they have had an alcoholic drink. The largest decrease was in 13 to 15-year-olds, where the percentage who had drunk alcohol fell from 67% to 35%.
Obesity
See the indicator>>

The proportion of adults who are obese has increased from 15% in 1993 to 28% in 2019.
Between 2006/07 and 2019/20, the proportion of children aged 10-11 who were obese increased from 17% to 21%.
HPV vaccination coverage
See the indicator>>

In the 2019/20 school year, coverage of two doses of the HPV vaccine (which helps protect against cervical cancer) fell to 65%, following school immunisation programmes being paused when schools closed during the first national lockdown. This compares to coverage of 84% for two doses in the 2018/19 school year.
Cancer screening
See the indicator>>

Breast screening coverage in England increased from 64% in 2001/02 to 77% in 2009/10, then remained stable until 2012/13, when it began to decrease. In 2019/20, breast screening coverage was 72%.
Cervical screening coverage for the total target age group (25 to 64 years) fell from 76% in 2010/11 to 72% in 2019/20.
Bowel screening coverage in England increased from 35% in 2009/10 to 64% in 2019/20.
GP referrals
See the indicator>>

Between the weeks starting 16 March and 13 April 2020, the number of two-week wait referrals for suspected cancer fell by 67%. Over the summer and autumn of 2020, referrals increased to similar numbers as before the Covid-19 pandemic. By the week starting 19 April 2021, there were 60,095 referrals for suspected cancer.
Diagnostic test waiting times
See the indicator>>

The proportion of patients waiting six weeks or more for a diagnostic test increased from 0.7% in February 2010 to 2.8% in February 2020. In March 2020, it began to increase dramatically, reaching 58% in May 2020. Since then, performance has improved but remains worse than before the pandemic. In March 2021, 24% of patients had been waiting six weeks or more for a diagnostic test.
Since 2008, the waiting list for a diagnostic test has been steadily increasing. However, in March 2020, the waiting list fell to 838,569 (22% lower than in March 2019). It has since increased to over 1.2 million in March 2021.
The number of diagnostic tests carried out has been increasing over time, but fell sharply from 1.9 million in February 2020 to 612,232 in April 2020. The number of tests carried out increased to over 1.9 million in March 2021.
Cancer waiting times
See the indicator>>

Between 2009 and 2014, the percentage of people with suspected cancer having their first consultant appointment within two weeks of an urgent GP referral fluctuated around 95%. Since then, performance has declined. In Q4 2020/21, 89% of patients had their first consultant appointment within two weeks.
The proportion of patients waiting less than 31 days for a first treatment for cancer following a decision to treat decreased from 98% in Q3 2009/10 to 96% in Q3 2020/21. The 96% threshold has not been met since Q3 2019/20.
The proportion of patients waiting less than two months to start cancer treatment following an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer has decreased considerably over time, from 87% in Q4 2008/09 to 72% in Q4 2020/21.
Patients’ overall experience of cancer services

Breast cancer mortality has been declining in the UK, falling from 38 deaths per 100,000 women in 2001 to 28 deaths per 100,000 women in 2016. However, the UK consistently has a relatively high breast cancer mortality rate compared to other countries.
In 2001, the UK had one of the highest cervical cancer mortality rates of all the comparator countries, but by 2016 the UK’s ranking had improved to about average.
Colorectal cancer mortality has been slowly decreasing over time in the UK, falling from 26 deaths per 100,000 population in 2001 to 22 deaths per 100,000 population in 2016. The UK’s performance is about average for the comparator countries.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Prisoner health and homeless health: understanding the links between them","Dr Miranda Davies & David Parker-Radford","Delivering health care in prisons presents unique challenges. Nuffield Trust’s research project, funded by the Health Foundation, is using hospital data to gain a better picture of the health needs of prisoners and the use they make of secondary health care services. We have also been thinking about the impact of wider social and contextual factors on the health of the prisoner population. This blog examines one common and striking characteristic – the number of prisoners with experience of homelessness before and after their imprisonment. 

Homelessness is hard to measure, but in 2017 it was estimated that over 250,000 people in England were homeless – around 1 in 200 people. At least 15% of people are homeless on arrival in prison, and an even larger proportion are likely to be homeless on release. Between January and March last year, more than 7,000 people left prison to either 'unsettled’ or unknown accommodation, which often translates into sleeping rough or temporary accommodation. When people describe prison as a revolving door, homelessness can be a contributory factor. 

But what are the health issues that link prisoners and those who are homeless, and are there common approaches that might help both groups?

Health care issues in common
We know that historical experience of abuse, being taken into care and unemployment can affect prisoners’ health , and the same can be true for people who become homeless. Indeed, while less than 1% of children are in care, a quarter of the prison population and a similar proportion of people who are homeless have been in the care system. This can affect people’s attachments, relationships and mental wellbeing.

Head injuries are also more prevalent for people who have these experiences than they are for other parts of society. Some 4% of all hospital admissions by prisoners relate to injuries to the head, and research in Glasgow found that being homeless means you are five times more likely than the rest of the population to be admitted to hospital with a traumatic brain injury.

Such injuries are often the result of assaults. Since 2010, physical attacks against prisoners have doubled.

Reducing staffing and funding in prisons contribute to an environment where prisons become less safe with an increased risk of being an assault victim. Self-harm incidents in prison are also at record highs according to the Prison Reform Trust. Crisis argues that people who are homeless are 17 times more likely to be a victim of violence, with one in three reporting they had been hit or kicked over the previous year.

Beyond head injuries, health needs related to the use of drugs and alcohol are also a significant issue. Crisis reports that two-thirds of people interviewed said that drug or alcohol use was a reason for them becoming homeless, while in 2017/18 more than 55,000 over 18s in secure settings such as prisons were receiving alcohol or drug treatment.

How can things be improved?
At a time where rough sleeping has increased by 165% since 2010, it’s more vital than ever to ensure that leaving prison does not lead to people becoming homeless, and that becoming homeless doesn’t lead towards imprisonment. We need more options for safe and secure accommodation for all people at risk of homelessness, including those leaving prison.

The government has launched a pilot project to support prisoners to find accommodation on release, but housing is only part of the picture – the way that health care is managed in prisons and on release also has a role to play. Prison provides regular food and somewhere to sleep, and for those with a health condition such as diabetes, being in that environment and having access to health care may mean it is well controlled. Leaving a routine without the right support in place, particularly if homeless, can contribute to people ending up in A&E or back in the criminal justice system.

Pilot projects that address specific health needs (such as the Drug Recovery Prison pilot) are helpful, but we need to know what ‘works’ or shows promise before applying it more broadly. What can be effective is for health professionals such as nurses providing support in prison that can continue to impact on health when people leave prisons.

For instance, last year the Queen’s Nursing Institute funded a project to offer latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing to prisoners at HMP Birmingham, aiming to improve people’s self-care on release. 10% of people tested positive for LTBI and were given vital treatment. The project offers an encouraging case for more people in prisons to have awareness about TB, as well as more testing in prisons to evaluate whether there is a public health case for a nationally applied prison screening programme. Having a community nurse able to come into prison to deliver care also helped to identify other issues and helped to join up care between prison health and the community health teams.

Breaking the cycle
Ultimately the health of people in prison is about more than what happens in prison. It reflects their wider experience such as homelessness, and it is important that these overlaps are acknowledged and underlying health problems addressed, to give prisoners the best possible chance of sustaining good health when they are released.

If some people arrive at prison having previously been homeless, and some leave prison with nowhere to go, it can be impossible to escape that cycle.

(0,"Can the Long Term Plan really save half a million lives?","Billy Palmer","Forecasting the future is inherently difficult. And given the NHS’s size and the multitude of factors affecting both service performance and patient outcomes, making predictions about the health service is particularly challenging. With the privilege of hindsight, we can reflect on some instances where goals were just too optimistic to be met, like the commitments to trusts returning to financial balance in year. At other times, apparently very high targets have actually been achieved – such as the push to limit waiting times to 18 weeks. So what would it take to achieve the headline ambition of the NHS Long Term Plan?

A bold ambition
NHS England’s press release led with the prediction that the Plan would “save up to half a million lives”, a number picked up by the media. The statement goes on to say the “latest technology… coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention [will] stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year” including saving 55,000 more cancer patients’ lives annually.

A death is deemed as:
■ amenable (treatable) if all or most deaths from that cause could be avoided through good quality healthcare (e.g. those caused by complications during birth)
■ preventable if, all or most deaths from that could be avoided by public health interventions in the broadest sense (e.g. from alcohol related diseases)
■ avoidable if preventable, amenable (treatable) or both. Because many deaths are both, this is less than the sum of the two categories.
On first inspection, these figures look demanding. Based on recent and historic Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, around a quarter of deaths in England – in the region of 110,000 a year – are avoidable, either through better healthcare or healthier public behaviours (see box). Of these only around 60,000 could be avoided through healthcare.

But single comparisons rarely give the entire picture and performance will be influenced not only by the scale of the action taken but also by the definitions used to measure it. So what do we need to assume and what needs to happen if these laudable ambitions are to be met? 

Consistent counting
How performance is measured will be a key factor, with the definition used to classify a ‘life saved’ having a large bearing on the number achieved. NHS England shared some details with us about how they added together figures from expert groups to reach their figure – and we can see there are indeed different definitions of avoided deaths at work. 

NHS England focus on those that are alive, counting the number of times a life is saved, whereas ONS focus on those that have died and instead count how many of these deaths could have been avoided. A person could be saved from both suicide and cancer, and count twice in NHS England’s sums but only reduce the national statistics by one.

NHS England also count people who survive for five years after diagnosis of cancer as being lives saved. But not all these people, sadly, will live much longer. Performance against this measure could improve purely through earlier diagnosis without actually prolonging lives although, of course, earlier diagnosis can contribute to better outcomes. The impact on the rate of deaths, which is what national statistics will show, would be less than the impact on five year survival. 

Increased scope
A growing and aging population might also help to make the target more manageable by increasing the number of lives to potentially save. While England’s population is only expected to grow by around 5% to 2028, the number of people aged over 75 is predicted to increase by around 30%. It is unclear quite how this will affect the number of potentially avoidable deaths but with increased prevalence of disease in this older population, there may be greater scope for life-saving interventions. However, progress here would require turning around a situation where life expectancy for these groups has recently been stalling.

Taking a closer look at the largest component within the overall figure – saving 55,000 more cancer patients’ lives annually – gives an indication of the potential effect of an aging and growing population. ONS estimated around 140,000 deaths from cancer in England in 2017. However, based on numbers from a 2016 study there could be an estimated 160,000 deaths from cancer in 2028.

This also demonstrates the importance of the definition of ‘lives saved’. If NHS England used the ONS definition of avoidable deaths, about a third of deaths would need to be avoided to meet the 55,000 lives saved. But the ONS deemed only around 36% of cancer deaths in 2016 were avoidable (see chart), so the goal would be equivalent to the total estimated number of avoidable cancer deaths. Including increasing five year survival rates in the definition obviously changes the picture.Action on over 75s
NHS England might also be identifying some causes of death as avoidable when the ONS would not. For most causes of deaths, the ONS exclude people 75 and over from their count of avoidable mortality. The majority of this cohort have three or more conditions on their death certificate making it difficult to estimate ‘avoidability’ of deaths. But, while not including them in their estimates, the ONS do recognise some conditions in the avoidable mortality definition may be effectively treated at older ages and so it would be right for NHS England to seek to include them in its calculation. This is a material consideration – around three-quarters of all deaths are for people aged 75 and over. The difficulty is that we don’t have a national statistical benchmark for knowing how avoidable their deaths are.

Best in class
International data on avoidable deaths, using OECD criteria similar to those of the ONS, suggests the NHS would have to become a world-beater to save half a million lives. The available data show we already have fewer avoidable deaths than average for EU countries, and matching the performance of the very best for preventable (Italy) and amenable (France) mortality would represent 28% and 33% falls, respectively – well short of what is required. On cancer, matching the best performance from a European country (Finland) within the data on deaths from cancer would represent a 21% fall.

Within England, reducing the nation’s average to that of the best performing region (East of England) in 2013 would only have resulted in around a 12,000 fall (11%) in deaths deemed avoidable in the ONS’s estimates. This suggests every area would likely have to increase its performance considerably – just matching the current best is unlikely to be sufficient.

Prioritise prevention
What the data can tell us is the importance of wider initiatives to improve health if something like this target is to be achievable. Nearly half of avoidable deaths are not considered amenable to healthcare but instead require broader prevention. Indeed, last year the WHO made a plea for more ambition tackling non-communicable diseases, such as strokes and most heart diseases, for which a person’s background, lifestyle and environment are risk factors. Their report challenges European countries to work on broader prevention in order to reduce premature mortality from such diseases by at least 45% by 2030. Against this ambition, the Plan’s goal looks rather conservative.

In this light the commitments in the Plan to use funding to support, for example, smoking cessation, obesity reduction and even cleaner air programmes are promising. Yet the NHS itself has relatively few levers over public health. The main budgets for it held by councils are being sharply cut, and services like police and education are under serious pressure. And these factors tend to determine health outcomes over a timescale of decades – longer even than a long term plan looks ahead.

Open book
The detailed “bottom up” approach NHS England explained to us, with efforts to prevent double-counting between the effect of different initiatives, is reassuring. And as we have seen, different definitions will lead to quite different numbers.

That said, we think it essential that NHS England are fully transparent and publish the calculation and its methodology. Health service managers and researchers need to understand their implications and what is required. Transparent publication would also help in judging performance later so there was no confusion or misunderstanding about the difference between ‘avoidable deaths’ (the international currency) and the goal of ‘lives saved’ that NHS England has set out.

But, whatever the definition, as my colleague John Appleby previously highlighted, avoidable deaths are worth being concerned about. So I’ll be keeping tabs on performance with a keen eye. And fingers crossed.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Win win: how smoke-free policies can benefit both the NHS and its patients","Euan Holmes","In July the Government published its new Tobacco Control Plan: Towards a smoke-free generation. It envisages a future in which the prevalence of smoking could be reduced to 5 per cent or less – a smoke-free generation.

A key theme is an increased emphasis on the role of the NHS in tackling tobacco use. In terms of specific policy, the Plan includes a government commitment to “support the implementation of smoke-free policies across all hospitals in England”, aiming for a smoke-free NHS estate by 2020.

Renewed commitment to this policy puts it under the spotlight, but it is crucial that its merits be evaluated not on its own, but as part of a broader framework seeking to achieve the Plan’s ambitious targets.

What is the harm?
Accounting for 27 per cent of lung cancer deaths, 35 per cent of respiratory deaths, and 13 per cent of all circulatory disease deaths, the impact of smoking on the health service is readily discernible. In addition, smokers are 38 per cent more likely to die from surgery than non-smokers.

A smoker’s visit to an NHS site often serves to underscore the harmful effects of tobacco use, but it is exactly this that can make NHS sites conducive to smoking cessation. The increased tangibility of risk can encourage quit attempts. Plus advice from clinicians is, as the Plan argues, “one of the most effective ways of triggering a quit attempt”.

In promoting this mindset, the Plan picks up a thread already present in NICE guidance, Very Brief Advice training, and Making Every Contact Count. The smoke-free estates policy can serve to unify these strands, providing the necessary backdrop, as well as give renewed impetus to encourage more smokers to quit.

Prohibiting smoking on NHS estates is not a means to punish those who smoke, but instead underlines that they are places where the harms caused by tobacco are recognised and challenged, and where efforts to quit are fully supported.

How should it be done?
For smoke-free policies to be fully effective, the referral processes and cessation support they seek to bolster must be firmly in place. For those who aim to quit, cessation must be seen as a treatment; referrals to smoking cessation services must be embedded in care pathways.

Effective implementation requires strong leadership and staff buy-in. Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of Public Health England, has written of how Medway NHS Foundation Trust, before the introduction of their smoke-free estates policy, offered staff free Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Helping staff to quit is an important part of the process identified by NICE, and it can help to bring staff on board – encouraging the ‘smoke-free champions’ that Selbie describes.

A comprehensive approach in line with NICE guidance is particularly crucial in mental health trusts. To complement its smoke-free policy, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) has ensured that all patients who smoke are supported, whether temporarily abstaining or starting a quit attempt.

Patients are offered NRT within 30 minutes of admission, as well as longer-term behavioural support to manage withdrawal symptoms. Those trying to quit can be referred to a specialist tobacco cessation adviser. E-cigarettes can also be used in specified areas on the site.

With this framework in place, SLaM’s smoke-free policy has not only encouraged patients to reduce their tobacco use, but has also seen the rate of physical assaults at the trust – both between patients and towards staff – drop by 39 per cent.

At what cost?
Under current financial conditions, policies like smoke-free estates may seem extracurricular. But, as the Five Year Forward View argues, preventative measures must be central to any efforts to reduce costs.

In London alone, it has been estimated that savings of around £2.6 million a year could be made if between 8 per cent and 17 per cent of smokers quit before having surgery.

The Welsh Government, which has since mandated smoke-free hospital grounds, has estimated that supporting smokers to quit before having surgery could save as much as £2.3 million every year. (These savings are derived from ‘bed days’ saved and the reduced cost of treating post-operative complications.)

Meanwhile, the Plan charts the cost of smoking to the economy as exceeding £11 billion per year, of which £2.5 billion was borne by the NHS. It has also been estimated that smoking increases the cost burden of social care to local authorities by a further £760 million.

What do the public think?
Public support for a ban on smoking in hospital grounds has grown in recent years. ASH’s Smoke-free Great Britain surveys, conducted by YouGov, show in that England agreement with the proposal stood at 62 per cent in 2011,1 rising to 69 per cent in 2014.2 In 2017, 72 per cent agreed, with only 15 per cent against the idea.3 Support for this measure is particularly pronounced in the north east, where rates of smoking-related illness and death are at their highest in England.

The verdict
Rolling out smoke-free NHS estates is not about making an example of smokers.

Instead – as the Plan makes clear – it is about enabling the NHS to lead by example. By creating an environment in which smoking cessation is fully supported, the NHS’s attempts to promote health and wellbeing can be strengthened.

It can also help to bolster the efforts of those who want to quit, at a time when the benefits of doing so are at their most stark.

(0,"Pregnancy and childbirth in prison: what do we know?","Dr Miranda Davies","The recent tragic death of a baby born at HMP Bronzefield raises serious questions about the care of pregnant women in prison in England, particularly when they are in labour. There has rightly been widespread condemnation of what happened, and the story has yet again highlighted how little we know about this small but vulnerable group of women.

There are currently 3,834 women in prison, and today the Guardian has published welcome new figures from NHS Digital about the numbers of births to women in custody or prison over five years. Yet prior to the tragedy in late September at HMP Bronzefield there were no formally reported figures of how many women in prison are pregnant and how many give birth in any given year.

The government has released some basic figures, indicating 47 pregnant women in prison on one specific day in October and fewer than five births in prison itself over the past year. But the means by which these figures were collected (a ‘bespoke counting exercise’) shows the lack of readily available and rigorous information in this area, and therefore the challenge of holding people to account when things go wrong.

What does Nuffield Trust analysis show?
Our forthcoming research will provide the most in-depth look yet at how prisoners are using hospital care, drawing on over 110,000 patient records. The full report will be published in the new year but today, as interest mounts on the topic of pregnancy and childbirth in prison, we publish some focused findings on this salient area of health care.

Our analysis found that, in 2017/18:

83 female prisoners were admitted to hospital for medical care relating to pregnancy or childbirth. 28 prisoners were in hospital for supervision of high-risk pregnancies.
A significant proportion of these women also had co-occurring mental health concerns, including 34 with tobacco-related issues, 26 with concerns related to opioid use and 23 experiencing depressive episodes.
There were more than 600 outpatient appointments for women in prison to attend midwifery services or obstetrics.
56 female prisoners gave birth during their prison stay, and over one in 10 of these (six prisoners) gave birth either in prison or on their way to hospital.
Being pregnant in prison
This week the Royal College of Midwives issued a call for pregnant prisoners to be given equivalent care to those outside of prison. Our research highlights a number of areas that need particular focus if this is to be achieved.

Where routine outpatient appointments are concerned, we can see that pregnant prisoners are experiencing fewer missed appointments than their non-pregnant counterparts in prison (22% of midwifery appointments compared to 39% of general outpatient appointments for women in prison). This suggests that prisons may be prioritising pregnant women’s health needs.

But when we compare outpatient appointments to the wider population, the numbers of missed appointments are far higher (22% of midwifery appointments compared to 14% in the wider population). This raises serious questions about whether pregnant women are able to access the same level of care as the wider population.

Moreover, the data also reveals that many of these women are admitted to hospital for supervision of high-risk pregnancies and that many of them have significant mental health needs. Clearly any policy to improve the outcomes of pregnant women in prison needs to be based in the reality that these patients have especially high needs.

Why shouldn’t women in prison give birth in their prison cell?
Our finding on the women that gave birth either in a prison cell or en route to hospital is worthy of particular focus. While the absolute number (six women) is small, this represents over one in 10 of all births that year. And yet prisons are in no way equipped to meet the needs of a woman in labour, or ensure the safe delivery of a baby.

For example, prisons are not staffed with round-the-clock midwives who are trained to support women in labour and know how labour is progressing, and there is no access to a range of pain relief options that a woman might use if she gave birth in hospital.

What’s more, the emotional impact of giving birth in a prison cell can be very significant. According to first-hand accounts, women prisoners often don’t feel that staff “believe” them when they say they are in labour. This may stem from the fact that the prison staff who are a first point of contact for a labouring prisoner are not health care professionals, and will inevitably have very different priorities.

Taken together with the finding that pregnant women in prison are likely to have significant co-occurring mental health problems, it is clear that this is a group of prisoners who are not being adequately supported at one of the most important and potentially stressful times of their life.

Caring for pregnant women in prison
The tragedy at HMP Bronzefield has rightly focused attention on the plight of female prisoners and the safety of prison as a place for pregnant women and their babies, prompting a further debate about the extent to which prison is ever the right place for pregnant women.

Answering this complex question is beyond the scope of our research, but our work makes clear that this is a small but highly vulnerable group of prisoners whose health needs are not being adequately met.

Surely it is not unreasonable, therefore, to expect that policy-makers can – and should – work harder to tailor services for pregnant women in prison. And if the death of a newborn baby behind bars doesn’t lead to real and lasting change, it is hard to know what will.",0,"Medicle","");

(0,"In discussion with: the 'digital doctor'","Robert Wachter MD","Why do you think the process of adopting technology into medicine has been so difficult?
I’ve studied the technological innovation and adaptations in other industries and it’s clear that our issues in health care are not unique. In medicine, we always tend to think that this is the first time the world has ever heard of these problems. This idea of the ‘productivity paradox’ – the lag between the adoption of technology and the realisation of productivity gains – is a well-known phenomenon. Technology enters industries and often those industries don’t quite know what to do with it. Perhaps they haven’t screwed it up quite as badly as we have in medicine, but technology never reaches its full potential at the very beginning.

There are a few reasons for that. One is the typical process of disruptive innovation: there are a lot of stakeholders that have an interest in the old way of working. And so the politics of changing things in a radical way are very complex.

But mostly, humans are generally just not very good at envisioning fundamental changes in the way they work. We tend to think incrementally. As a quote often attributed to Henry Ford goes, “If I’d asked people what they wanted, they would have said ‘faster horses’.”

Are there aspects of the health care profession that have made it more challenging?
A unique aspect of computer adoption in health care is that it didn't occur organically. In many other industries, what you saw was a very natural technology adoption curve, where you had early adopters and then laggards and then, eventually, everybody got there.

But, in health care, people were so resistant to ubiquitous technology – electronic health records, particularly – that it took a long time for it to happen. And then, when it did, at least in the US, it happened very quickly. So we went from essentially nothing to nearly everybody having electronic health records in three to five years.

The result of this is that nobody’s had the time to do the adaptation phase. In other industries, by the time the rank and file and the laggards adopt a technology, the early adopters have had it for 10 years and they’ve already traversed the curve, working out the bugs and developing a model that was replicable. That’s what we’ve been missing in health care.

How do we find our way out of the so-called ‘productivity paradox’?
Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT, who coined that phrase, said that the history of technology teaches us that, as it enters industries, people think it is going to be immediately transformative. In the business world, they think it’s going to revolutionise the industry, whether that be manufacturing, publishing or something else.

You need two keys to resolve the paradox. One of them is the technology, which of course needs to get better. But the second is that the work needs to be reimagined. You can’t just recreate your analogue processes with technology, without rethinking them. You need a new generation of leaders who are not wedded to a certain way of thinking, who are willing to challenge existing ways of working that are just no longer fit for purpose. Hospitals are now in a business where they are not going to be able to survive unless they demonstrably produce a high-quality, safe ’product‘ at the lowest cost. It’s not a theory any more: it feels very real. As people begin to reorganise, they are forced to consider how technology can help them to do that. That business case to improve performance is a very important adjunct to this.

Ultimately, work must be transformed, both by generational change within existing organisations but, very importantly, by technology serving as a fulcrum, an enabler, for new entrants into the market that had no access to the health care world before. And that’s everything from technology companies – whether it’s Google or Apple or start-ups – to patients and their advocates, now enabled and empowered by technology to transform a market that they previously had to be completely passive in.

Eventually, it has much more to do with the choices, the policy and the paradigms shifting, than it has to do with the actual interfaces and the software.

The tone at the end of your book is ultimately one of optimism for technology in health care. Do you still feel that way?
Believe me, when I started writing, I wasn’t doing it from a mindset of optimism! Ultimately, the reason I started writing the book in the first place was because I was disappointed. I had seen how remarkable IT could be in other aspects of my life, and how transformative it was in other industries. Yet I wasn’t seeing any of that in our own work.

That was what catalysed me to start writing the book, but I did go in with an open mind for the future. And the more I spoke to people, the more they cemented my feeling of disappointment with where we were. But they also solidified a feeling of hope. I could see the early forces, the early innovations and attitudes that will ultimately help us mature digital health care into something that really works.

It’s going to take a while, and we have to make some better decisions first. But, after a while, we will get there.

In this video, you’ll learn 7 advanced tips for taking your interview skills to the next level. There's a bonus tip at the end of the video.

Interviewing is an important part of the hiring process and it's vital to make a great impression during a job interview. There are certain skills that will help you succeed during that interview, including communication skills and professionalism. The more you understand about interview skills, the better prepared you'll be for your next interview.

In this article, we explore the definition of interview skills, as well as 10 skills that can help you ace your next job interview.What are interview skills?
Interview skills are skills or actions that allow a person to be more effective throughout the interview process for a new position. Not all interview skills are conventional; rather, many interview skills help candidates prepare for the interview and guide them as they participate in job interviews. Acing job interviews requires in-depth preparation as well as the ability to feel comfortable and confident when discussing your skills, experience and qualifications with hiring managers.10 interview skills that help you stand out as a candidate
The following are a few of the most important interview skills that can support the interview process and help set you apart from other candidates:

1. Research
Before you go into an interview, it's important to spend time researching both the company and the position you're applying for. There are several ways you can research an organization, including by:

Reviewing their website, especially the About page
Googling the company name and reading any press releases or other information available
Looking at the company's social media platforms
Talking to employees of the company, if possible
Researching job platforms that provide feedback from current and previous employees about the company
You should also take time to obtain as much information as possible about the job you are interviewing for. Thoroughly review the job listing, look on the company website for the job listing if available to see if additional details are included and look up current employees who hold the same or similar positions. You can also research the job title in general to get a more broad idea of what's expected and typical duties in that position. The more you know about the position, the better prepared you'll be when going into the interview.

2. Preparation
You should avoid going into an interview unprepared. Doing so may reflect negatively on you as a candidate, and most hiring managers can easily detect applicants who are not prepared. Set aside at least an hour to prepare the day before or on the day of the interview. Here are a few actions to take when preparing:

Re-read the job description and determine the most relevant responsibilities and requirements for the position.
Come up with several specific answers to potential questions related to the position you're applying for and the duties that will be expected of you.
Make a list of the essential aspects of the job so you have it on hand when answering and asking questions during the job interview.
Go over your cover letter and resume you provided to the company to ensure you remember how you initially presented yourself.
Spend several minutes or even hours researching possible interview questions related to the position you're applying for and the industry the company is part of.
Look up less specific interview questions that aren't directly related to the job, but may still be asked. For example, practice a few behavioral and situational interview questions.
Practice answering interview questions with a friend or family member so you feel comfortable when answering questions during the actual interview.
Prepare several specific examples from your previous job experience, including milestones, challenges and successes. These will support your interview answers and help strengthen your responses.
Look over your notes you prepared on the company during the research process to ensure the information is fresh in your mind when going into the interview.
3. Punctuality
On the day of the interview, make sure you arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled interview time. Punctuality is an important trait that hiring managers and employers value and gives them an idea of how punctual you will be on a daily basis if you are hired for the position.

To ensure you arrive on time, consider planning out your outfit the night before and ironing it so that it's ready the next day. You should also back your purse or briefcase the night before and ensure you have a copy of your resume and cover letter on hand. Set an alarm and make sure you have reliable transportation for the time of the interview.

4. Professionalism
There are several aspects that go into professionalism, and all of them are important when attending a job interview. To begin, ensure your attire is professional and tasteful and is neatly pressed and clean. Avoid wearing clothes that are too casual, too large or small, too revealing or too flamboyant. Aim for an outfit with neutral colors that match and are not distracting or offensive. If you are unsure of the dress code requirements for the interview, dress in a more formal way to avoid dressing too casually.

When arriving at the interview location, use professional language when checking in and greeting the interviewer. Be polite to everyone you come into contact with, including other employees and receptionists. The more polite and professional you are in your actions and words, the more kind and pleasant you can come off to employers.5. Communication
Good communication skills are crucial during the job interview process. This includes written, verbal and nonverbal communication skills. A few key tips to keep in mind when communicating with others during an interview include:

Address the interview by name and ensure you pronounce the name or names correctly.
Begin the interview with appropriate small talk. It's best to come prepared with a few conversation starters that are professional and conducive to an interview setting.
Match your communication style to the hiring manager. For example, if the hiring manager is communicating in a professional way, try to match your tone to theirs. If they are more upbeat and offer jokes here and there, don't be afraid to do the same as long as they're appropriate.
Avoid interrupting the person you are interviewing with when they are speaking.
Don't use jargon or abbreviated language when speaking with the interviewer.
Try to avoid using speech fillers like um and like.
Copy the interviewer's body language. For example, if they are sitting in an upright position with their hands on the table, do the same.
Be aware of your own body language to ensure you are presenting yourself in a professional and positive way.

6. Listening
Listening skills are another important component of a successful interview experience. It's easy to listen to a person speak, and while doing so to think to yourself how you will respond. While this may seem wise, it can also prevent you from actually hearing what the other person is saying. Listen attentively when the hiring manager is speaking, paraphrase what they said either in your mind or out loud when appropriate and use nonverbal cues such as nodding, making eye contact and leaning in when the other person is talking.

You should also ask for clarification if you misunderstand something that was said to ensure communication is effective. Avoid quickly changing the subject and take note of any nonverbal cues the interviewer is giving you, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, to further understand what's being said.

7. Ask questions
Hiring managers often ask candidates if they have any questions during or after the interview. Interviewers look for candidates who ask genuine questions to help them gain a better understanding of the company and the role. Arrive at the interview prepared with a few questions to ask the interviewer that demonstrates a genuine interest in the opportunity and provides a chance to further discuss elements of the job that may not have been covered.

8. Confidence
Confidence has a significant impact on how you are perceived by interviewers. Arrive at the interview ready to discuss your experience, accomplishments and abilities in a confident way that conveys your own belief in yourself to perform the duties of the position you applied for. Work to exude a balanced and kind sense of confidence rather than simply boasting about your qualifications.

9. Showing interest
It's important to convey your genuine interest in the position during a job interview. If you give off a sense of disinterest or apathy, the interviewer may think you don't truly want the position or care about the outcome of the interview. Work to show earnest interest in the organization and position and a passion for your work and your abilities to complete the duties of the job.

10. Follow-up
Following up soon after an interview is considered crucial by many recruiters and hiring managers. A simple thank-you card or thank-you email can go a long way to show the interviewer you are genuinely interested in the position and are grateful for their time. Try to send a follow-up email or note the same day as the interview or the next day at the latest.",0,"Interview",""),
(0,"Strategies of Effective Interviewing","Samuel G. Trull","The executive engaged in the normal conduct of business devotes much of his time to interviewing. However, there is an appalling lack of effort given to systematic attempts at building improvements into this age-old process. Interviewing remains one of those activities which we think we know all about merely because we have been doing it so long; we have been lulled by habit. It seems apparent that a modest effort aimed at an analysis of our interviewing techniques would yield generous returns.

In the broad sense, interviewing is the process whereby individuals (usually two) exchange information. The individuals may be concerned with a job opening, a promotion, a special assignment, a product sale, information for intelligence purposes, a proposed merger, or other questions. The information exchanged need not be limited to facts. In business, particularly, such products of an interview as meaning and understanding are oftentimes more significant than objective factual statements.

Interviewing in the contemporary business setting invariably takes place in an atmosphere filled with a sense of urgency. The time allocated to the interview is necessarily limited. Consequently, a nondirective approach finds little application; it is necessary to use the guided interview in the vast majority of situations. This inherent time constraint sometimes brings about dysfunctional consequences: the interviewer is so preoccupied with budgeting his time that the content and the purpose of the interview are vitiated. Hence, we must define what we mean by an effective interview. For the purposes of this article, an effective interview is one that optimizes the perceived communication objectives of the individuals involved, with time as the principal constraint. We shall focus on research findings concerning:

The proper kind of preparation for the interview.
Value of such procedures as having an outline of points to be covered and taking notes.
Use (and misuse) of questions and questioning techniques.
The kind and amount of control that the interviewer should exercise over the discussion.
Analysis and evaluation of information obtained.
Planning & Preparation
The lack of adequate planning for an interview is the greatest single fault found in my studies of the interviewing process.1 All too often, the inexperienced interviewer launches into a discussion only to find midway through that his preparation is incomplete. A moderate amount of preplanning can easily obviate such unfortunate occurrences.

When the objective of the interview is well-known in advance, it is usually a good practice to allow the individual concerned ample time to prepare for the talk before the actual involvement. By indicating, ahead of time and in writing, the points to be covered, the interviewer gives the interviewee an added advantage and reinforces the specific purpose of the session. Too often the expectations of the interviewee may be far different from those of the interviewer. This misunderstanding, if not corrected, can be disastrous.

On the other hand, too much preplanning and detailing for an interview can be equally harmful. The interviewee may then develop conventionally correct answers or platitudes which, of course, reduce the informational content of the interview to virtually zero. In short, he needs a guide, a “steer”—but no more than that.

A written outline of important points to be covered is not necessarily an indication of rigidity; rather, it reflects consideration for all parties concerned. When explained, it generates a feeling of confidence as well as fairness—particularly if two or more people are to be ranked in an evaluation. The outline may even include typical questions in order to solicit comparable responses. Again, however, a warning against excess is needed: too much reliance on a programed questioning approach is often disconcerting to the interviewee and may lead to stereotyped answers. Ideally, of course, each question should be designed for the situation and the respondent.

In presenting information, a speaker allocates blocks of time to various items on his agenda. If no time limit is established, the presentation can continue indefinitely. Even worse, the truly important information may never be told. This process takes place by dint of the normal human trait of retaining the most significant bits of information for the end. Psychiatrists recognize this and are particularly attentive in the last ten minutes of the therapy session. Borrowing from this insight, the interviewer, although not able to set an hourly cycle as does the psychiatrist, should try discreetly to indicate a time scale. This allows the interviewee to plan and to include relevant information which otherwise might be withheld. If the interview is terminated too abruptly, the probability of losing valuable information is very high.

A time limit can be suggested by citing the next appointment or by noting, perhaps, a previously scheduled conference. Actions such as tapping—consciously or not—on one’s watch to indicate time are out of order, of course; so is sitting precipitously on the edge of the chair. Sometimes it may be in the best interest of both parties to set another date for an extended session or to plan on completing only one or two stages of progress at a time.

Building Rapport
Certainly the general tone of the interview should be one of helpfulness and friendliness so as to minimize the immediate barriers to forthright communication. In this connection it should be mentioned that privacy is a first prerequisite to good interviewing. An important component of this is freedom from distracting interruptions. (The telephone many times is such a distraction.)

In order to establish the critically important element of rapport with the interviewee, a genuine attempt should be made to put the interviewee at ease—especially in job application, promotion, or other interviews where significant differences in status exist. Unfortunately, sometimes this rapport is attempted by such gaucheries as, “Now, don’t be nervous!” or, “Relax!”
Normally, at the beginning of an interview an allowance should be made for the interviewee to adjust to the interview environment. The situation is new for the interviewee; it may be his or her first experience of this kind. Unless there is a specified adaptation period, the interviewee may be unable to reduce his or her level of anxiety, with the resulting loss of the entire session. Part of this adaptive process is familiarization with the surroundings. It is an often overlooked truism that whenever an individual is placed in a strange situation, he becomes apprehensive.

Overcoming this fear is often a most difficult procedure. By explaining, for example, the need for commonplace objects such as pencil and note paper that are anxiety-provoking, the level of tension may be reduced. Also, it is well to remember that the manner and simple courtesies extended by the interviewer are greatly magnified in the eyes of the interviewee. Thus, a limited amount of pleasantries may be condoned if they fulfill this useful purpose.

By jotting down significant bits of information, the interviewer can readily reconstruct what actually took place. The record assists with details which would be hard to remember if not recorded. The time that would be needed to fix them in mind without benefit of notes can be used to greater advantage listening and thinking. Then, too, writing down items compliments the interviewee; it means that his responses are considered important enough to be recorded. It is a convenient reinforcing mechanism; it may even be used to guide the path of the interview.

Information of a picayune variety should naturally be avoided. Similarly, allowing the interviewee to relate too much information can be dangerous. Any inadvertently revealed facts or incidents may bring about severe anxiety feelings when he or she reflects on them later. Temptations to divulge information too freely should be sidestepped as lightly as possible so that continued rapport may be maintained. In addition, circumspection should be exercised at all times lest the interviewer become too emotionally involved in the exchange. Disagreements tend to provoke planning for verbal counterattacks with the result that the informational content is lost.

Guiding the conversation
The interviewee is overly sensitive to all reactions by the interviewer. Taking advantage of this, the interviewer may easily steer the conversation along the most productive channels. Small inflections in the voice give encouragement. By repeating phrases already expressed, one finds the respondent expanding with details on a relevant issue. Sometimes, merely restating the reply allows a time for reflection and quite natural expansion or clarification of a point perhaps lost in the first verbalization. Phrasing a question by rewording it into a rhetorical one gives the interviewee a period to think through a definite response (although caution should be observed that the “right” words are not put into the mind of the interviewee).

Support given by nodding is most effective. Other nonverbal means of rendering assistance are equally significant. The use of semiverbal expressions of a meaningless nature—for instance, “Umm…”—can prove most useful. Because such utterances provide no direct interpretation, they are received as the interviewee wants to receive them. He then emphasizes or magnifies the point as he sees fit.

A succinct summary of information from time to time not only allows for clarity in the communication process but also gives the informant a mirror of just what has occurred. Alterations can be made easily by the interviewee once he hears what he has said. In the final stage, a precise statement of what was agreed on or of the general conclusions reached often allows for a reduction of confusion.

When details or figures have been discussed, the summary can often be in the form of a written memorandum. If the interviewer wants to be sure of what the interviewee communicated or to check on whether the interviewee really understood the data discussed, he can ask him to write the memorandum.
Developing Information
The tools of the interviewer are his questions. They should be used with dispatch and yet with the utmost care. Sarcasm or obscure humor should be avoided unless the interviewer is positive that the interviewee perceives them as such. Usually, the latter’s interpretation of such activity is entirely serious; he or she may respond at the time with a semblance of perceived humor, but the real reaction is often deep concern and suspicion.

Through the judicious use of questions, the skilled interviewer not only obtains information but also guides the talk along productive lines. Leading questions or questions designed with built-in responses are usually not very effective. Similarly, the double negative type of interrogation is to be shunned as it tends to evoke anxiety. To avoid slipping into such traps, even the best interviewer should review his questioning techniques from time to time. Thus, self-analyzing by tape recording or by having a third person observe an interview for diagnostic purposes can prevent poor techniques from developing into set procedures. This process may be extended to the use of video tape recordings with proportionately more significant results.

In a research project that concentrated on questioning techniques, I analyzed the recordings of about 100 interviews held for the purpose of selecting job applicants, appraising executive performance, or counseling employees in their careers. One of the conclusions from this study is this: successful interviewers (as evaluated by information obtained) utilize at the outset of the interview a pattern of broad, general questions. Apparently this allows the respondent to answer with information which he feels is important, as well as providing him the opportunity to expand into areas that he deems to be of vital concern. Once this information is released, the interviewer can sharpen the focus with specific questions eliciting short answers. For example, the “yes or no” kind of question should be reserved for the final exploration of a subject, while queries such as “How do you feel about working with Joe Smith’s group?” might well obtain results most useful at the beginning of a particular subject.

Fear of silence
It seems that silence in our society is to be avoided at virtually all times and all places. Unfortunately, this feeling affects the interview. Usually fear of silence is felt most by the inexperienced interviewer. All too often he tends to put forth another question while the respondent is meekly attempting to formulate his own thoughts into a logical reply—all just to keep the air filled with words.

The tendency to hurry questions and answers is compounded by the distorted sense of time that people get during an interview. To understand the amount of distortion, one research group carried out such simple tests as stopping a conversation for a short period. Interviewers’ estimates of the period of silence magnified it by a factor of from 10 to 100!2 On the other hand, I find, when asking participants in an interview to estimate the time elapsed, invariably the interviewee underestimates the period. Consequently, the interviewer in particular should be cautious of pushing forward too quickly. In many instances, if he will permit another few seconds to elapse, he will obtain vital bits of information that would otherwise be lost or allowed to remain in a half-expressed state in the interviewee’s thought processes.

During these periods of silence, the interviewer may profitably spend his time pondering the question: “What is he really trying to tell me?” Often the content of the interview makes an incomplete story when analyzed later on. Not only may the words fall far short of the desired goal, but also they may convey misunderstandings. Allowances for the ever-present failures in semantics must constantly be made, and further interrogation conducted, in order that a clear approximation of the true meaning be obtained.

Art of listening
The often posed maxim to the effect that we hear what we wish to hear does not appear at first glance to be a profound statement. Yet it summarizes the mechanics that lie behind poor listening techniques. Individual biases and attitudes as well as role perceptions and stereotyping all contribute to the phenomenon of selective perception. Thus, in order to obtain the best possible information, it is necessary that one be aware of his own particular filters that tend to impede if not prevent clear and relatively undistorted reception of information.

It is possible to hear at the rate of from 110 to 140 words per minute over sustained periods.3 The thinking or thought projection rate is approximately seven times this figure. The result is a surplus of thinking time over listening time. The manner in which this surplus time is utilized varies, of course, with the individual. However, it is at this point that the interviewer tends to project his ideas into the interview process, thereby filtering out the interviewee’s responses.
One result is that he makes assumptions about the respondent and his information that are compatible not so much with the interviewee as with what the interviewer has already concluded about the interviewee. Suffice it to say that it is altogether more rewarding to spend this extra time in formulating hypotheses, which later can be confirmed or denied as more information is revealed, or in constructing a frame of reference for the on-going interview, which allows acquired information to be categorized easily as it is given.",0,"Interview",""),
(0,"This is probably the most complete interview etiquette","Anonymous","1. Preparation before the interview

1. Make a correct positioning of yourself

Choose an industry that suits you, not an industry that suits your major. Communicate with others more, listen to their opinions, and finally figure out what you can do and what you want to do based on your own personality characteristics, interest orientation, etc. Never forget opportunities are always for those who are ready.



2. Find information about the employer through various channels

Employers' information includes the company's main products, business projects, management methods, and the qualities they expect employees to have in this particular position. This can be very helpful in responding to the interviewer's questions during the interview. If necessary, you can go to the interview site in advance to familiarize yourself with the environment, and you even need to figure out the location of the toilet.



3. A well-designed personal image

It is recommended that the attire should be as consistent or similar to the employer as possible to give the other party a sense of intimacy and make the interviewer feel that you are one of them and that you want to be one of them. If you have difficulties in this regard, you can also dress according to the following suggestions. The ultimate goal is to show your mental outlook and leave a good impression on the employer. Among them, men and women can dress like this:

1) Men can wear a suit, preferably a dark blue suit with wool. It is best to have no more than three body colors. It can be matched with a pair of black leather shoes, a pair of dark socks and a tie. The suit should be flat, clean, and have trouser lines; nothing should be placed in the suit pocket; the suit logo must be removed. Before the interview, you should get a haircut, manicure, shave, and nose hair removal, and be sure to take care of these details.

In addition, remember to wash your face twice on the day of the interview, and use some hair care and skin care products, preferably with an elegant fragrance; you can also spray some perfume on your suit, preferably the night before, to ensure that it is not too pungent, Otherwise, the interviewer will feel uncomfortable. Whether it's hair care, skin care products, or fragrances, it's important to keep the scent consistent.

Bringing a briefcase with you when applying for a job can give the impression of a professional. The briefcase does not require buying a very expensive leather bag, but it should look generous and elegant, and the size should be able to hold A4-sized documents flatly.

2) Ladies can wear formal suits and skirts, and should also abide by the three-color principle. The skirt should be no higher than three centimeters above the knee. Wear stockings and a pair of lace-up shoes. High heels should not be worn. It can be matched with a small earring or brooch, but avoid too many accessories. Be generous and decent. The hairstyle is elegant, solemn, neatly combed, and long hair is best clipped with bobby pins, not bright colors. Lighten up, don't leave long nails, preferably a natural color nail polish.

2. Precautions during the interview process

Arrive at the interview location 10 minutes early. Too early or too late will make the interviewer feel that you have no sense of time. Finally, check whether the instrument needs to be touched up with makeup, see if there is any messy lipstick in the hairstyle and whether there is any debris between the teeth, etc., and look at it with a small mirror. When you feel that everything is ready, you can take an interview with the company calmly. There are still some details to pay attention to during this period, which are listed as follows:

1. It is taboo to nag with others. When you happen to meet friends or acquaintances in the reception room, you must not speak loudly or laugh like no one else;

2, do not eat, including chewing gum; do not smoke;

3. Treat other staff with courtesy, take the initiative to say hello or nod;

4. Turn off all communication equipment to avoid embarrassing scenes during the interview;

5. You can exchange information with other applicants in a soft voice, which can also reflect your willingness to help others, modesty and eagerness to learn;

6. Don't pay too much attention to the conversations of non-interview staff members, and don't make comments rashly;

7. During the waiting process, there should also be standing and sitting;

8. Don't bother to look at the materials you bring with you to relieve tension;

9. Don't bring too many things, usually take a document to pack some interview materials, or a personal resume.

10. When the interviewer calls you, be sure to answer yes loudly and then go in for the interview. Whether the door is open, closed, or half-open, you should knock on it. When knocking on the door, tap your knuckles three times, and the intensity should be heard by the interviewer. Wait until you reply before opening the door and go in. The door must be opened lightly. After entering, gently close the door, say hello to the interviewer, bow or nod, and say your name clearly.

11. Don't shake hands with each other rashly unless he stretches out his hand first. When shaking hands, make sure that the arms are in an L shape, with the palms facing upwards and facing each other from bottom to top. When shaking hands, use a force of two to three kilograms, and shake it vertically for two to three times. Be sure to show your enthusiasm and self-confidence.

12. Remember not to take a seat rashly before the other party invites you to take a seat. The person who hung himself on the chair before the interviewer opened his mouth has already deducted half of his points. If the other party has never invited you to take a seat, and there is a seat in that position, you can ask Can I sit here? at the right time. After getting the other party's permission, say thank you, and then sit down generously. .

The sitting posture of men and women during the interview is also very particular:

Men: Be light when seated, at least fill 2/3 of the chair, lean back lightly against the back of the chair, keep your knees close together (men can be slightly apart), and place your hands on your knees. The body can be leaned forward slightly to show respect and humility.

Ladies: Support the skirt with the back of your hands before sitting down. After sitting down, tuck the corners of the skirt, bring your legs together, put your feet to the left or right at the same time, and place your hands on your legs. If you sit upright for a long time, you can cross and stack your legs, but you should pay attention to the upper legs and the toes down.

When dealing with gaze, it is best to look at the other person's eye-nose triangle (the social area), but don't keep staring at it, otherwise the other person will think you are weird and should move your eyes from time to time. If there is more than one interviewer, be sure to glance at the others when answering the question, and focus on the interviewer. If the other interviewer asks you a separate question, be sure to shift the focus to him, and then shift back when you're done. When thinking about a problem, look at the wall behind the person, not the ceiling or the window.

Be highly focused. Whether the conversation is speculative or not, or the other party has other activities, such as temporarily processing documents, answering a phone call, etc. Don't be distracted by it. Don't look around and seem like you're not listening. If you are inattentive to the other person's questions, empty words, or casually explain a phenomenon, make rash assertions to show your shrewdness. Or ask questions like a barrage of questions, making the other party feel that you are too enthusiastic and demanding, so that it is difficult to deal with, which is easy to destroy the conversation and is a bad conversation habit. Quickly understand the other party's question and give the answer quickly. Of course, you can think about some difficult questions for a while. Don't show that you don't understand the other party's question and cause the other party to ask you another way, which will give the other party a chance Leaves the impression that your thinking is confused and logical.

The answer should be sincere, knowing what you know, and not knowing what you don't know. Carry a notebook with you and write down something. On the one hand, it is a kind of respect for the other party; on the other hand, it is to avoid the above-mentioned questions. Whether the other party can answer this question later.

The delivery should be generous and decent, presented with both hands. If more than one person submits the same material, you should pay attention to the order of submission. You can submit them in the order of the position of the other party. If you are not clear about this, you can also submit them in order from near to far. The actions must be generous, decent, and not sloppy.

Pay attention to each other and end the interview in a timely manner. If the other person seems interested (lean forward), you are doing well and can continue. If the other person shows obvious impatience (yawning or staring blankly), you can stop and ask him: Do you want me to talk about... (what I just said), or do you want to hear me in XX Aspects of skills? Guiding each other at the right time. If the other person wants to end the interview as soon as possible (pack up their diplomas or stand up) you should understand that it is wise to end the interview at this time, and should take the initiative and ask what is their next step after the interview?

After the interview, stand up, express your gratitude to the other party, and slowly exit the interview room facing the other party. Don't walk too fast, lest the other party mistake you for nervousness, stage fright, or other important things to leave so quickly. When you finally go out, you must nod again to the interviewer and gently close the door.

Three, the necessary etiquette after the interview

1. After three days, call again, not too early, and the talk time should not exceed five minutes;

2. Thank you first, and then ask about the interview;

3. Looking for other units in a row, before the other party does not give you a letter of appointment, you should try a few more units, and you must not wait for the rabbits and wait for work;

4. If you fail in the competition, don't be discouraged. This time I failed, and there will be more than one job opportunity next time. The key is to sum up experience and lessons, find out the reasons for the failure, and make new preparations for these deficiencies.",0,"Interview","");

(0,"The Bogey-Beast","Flora Annie Steel","There was once a woman who was very, very cheerful, though she had little to make her so; for she was old, and poor, and lonely. She lived in a little bit of a cottage and earned a scant living by running errands for her neighbours, getting a bite here, a sup there, as reward for her services. So she made shift to get on, and always looked as spry and cheery as if she had not a want in the world.

Now one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch!

Goodness me! she cried, that would be just the very thing for me if I only had something to put in it! But I haven't! Now who could have left it in the ditch?

And she looked about her expecting the owner would not be far off; but she could see nobody.

Maybe there is a hole in it, she went on, and that's why it has been cast away. But it would do fine to put a flower in for my window; so I'll just take it home with me.

And with that she lifted the lid and looked inside. Mercy me! she cried, fair amazed. If it isn't full of gold pieces. Here's luck!

And so it was, brimful of great gold coins. Well, at first she simply stood stock-still, wondering if she was standing on her head or her heels. Then she began saying:

Lawks! But I do feel rich. I feel awful rich!

After she had said this many times, she began to wonder how she was to get her treasure home. It was too heavy for her to carry, and she could see no better way than to tie the end of her shawl to it and drag it behind her like a go-cart.

It will soon be dark, she said to herself as she trotted along. So much the better! The neighbours will not see what I'm bringing home, and I shall have all the night to myself, and be able to think what I'll do! Mayhap I'll buy a grand house and just sit by the fire with a cup o' tea and do no work at all like a queen. Or maybe I'll bury it at the garden foot and just keep a bit in the old china teapot on the chimney-piece. Or maybe—Goody! Goody! I feel that grand I don't know myself.

By this time she was a bit tired of dragging such a heavy weight, and, stopping to rest a while, turned to look at her treasure.

And lo! it wasn't a pot of gold at all! It was nothing but a lump of silver.

She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes, and stared at it again.

Well! I never! she said at last. And me thinking it was a pot of gold! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! Silver is far less trouble—easier to mind, and not so easy stolen. Them gold pieces would have been the death o' me, and with this great lump of silver—

So she went off again planning what she would do, and feeling as rich as rich, until becoming a bit tired again she stopped to rest and gave a look round to see if her treasure was safe; and she saw nothing but a great lump of iron!

Well! I never! says she again. And I mistaking it for silver! I must have been dreaming. But this is luck! It's real convenient. I can get penny pieces for old iron, and penny pieces are a deal handier for me than your gold and silver. Why! I should never have slept a wink for fear of being robbed. But a penny piece comes in useful, and I shall sell that iron for a lot and be real rich—rolling rich.

So on she trotted full of plans as to how she would spend her penny pieces, till once more she stopped to rest and looked round to see her treasure was safe. And this time she saw nothing but a big stone.

Well! I never! she cried, full of smiles. And to think I mistook it for iron. I must have been dreaming. But here's luck indeed, and me wanting a stone terrible bad to stick open the gate. Eh my! but it's a change for the better! It's a fine thing to have good luck.

So, all in a hurry to see how the stone would keep the gate open, she trotted off down the hill till she came to her own cottage. She unlatched the gate and then turned to unfasten her shawl from the stone which lay on the path behind her. Aye! It was a stone sure enough. There was plenty light to see it lying there, douce and peaceable as a stone should.

So she bent over it to unfasten the shawl end, when—Oh my! All of a sudden it gave a jump, a squeal, and in one moment was as big as a haystack. Then it let down four great lanky legs and threw out two long ears, nourished a great long tail and romped off, kicking and squealing and whinnying and laughing like a naughty, mischievous boy!

The old woman stared after it till it was fairly out of sight, then she burst out laughing too.

Well! she chuckled, I am in luck! Quite the luckiest body hereabouts. Fancy my seeing the Bogey-Beast all to myself; and making myself so free with it too! My goodness! I do feel that uplifted—that GRAND!—

So she went into her cottage and spent the evening chuckling over her good luck.",0,"Fun",""),
(0,"A Respectable Woman","Kate Chopin","They had entertained a good deal during the winter; much of the time had also been passed in New Orleans in various forms of mild dissipation. She was looking forward to a period of unbroken rest, now, and undisturbed tete-a-tete with her husband, when he informed her that Gouvernail was coming up to stay a week or two.

This was a man she had heard much of but never seen. He had been her husband's college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense a society man or a man about town, which were, perhaps, some of the reasons she had never met him. But she had unconsciously formed an image of him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical; with eye-glasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not like him. Gouvernail was slim enough, but he wasn't very tall nor very cynical; neither did he wear eyeglasses nor carry his hands in his pockets. And she rather liked him when he first presented himself.

But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself when she partly attempted to do so. She could discover in him none of those brilliant and promising traits which Gaston, her husband, had often assured her that he possessed. On the contrary, he sat rather mute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him feel at home and in face of Gaston's frank and wordy hospitality. His manner was as courteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require; but he made no direct appeal to her approval or even esteem.

Once settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide portico in the shade of one of the big Corinthian pillars, smoking his cigar lazily and listening attentively to Gaston's experience as a sugar planter.

This is what I call living, he would utter with deep satisfaction, as the air that swept across the sugar field caressed him with its warm and scented velvety touch. It pleased him also to get on familiar terms with the big dogs that came about him, rubbing themselves sociably against his legs. He did not care to fish, and displayed no eagerness to go out and kill grosbecs when Gaston proposed doing so.Gouvernail's personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, but she liked him. Indeed, he was a lovable, inoffensive fellow. After a few days, when she could understand him no better than at first, she gave over being puzzled and remained piqued. In this mood she left her husband and her guest, for the most part, alone together. Then finding that Gouvernail took no manner of exception to her action, she imposed her society upon him, accompanying him in his idle strolls to the mill and walks along the batture. She persistently sought to penetrate the reserve in which he had unconsciously enveloped himself.When is he going--your friend?she one day asked her husband.For my part, he tires me frightfully.Not for a week yet, dear. I can't understand; he gives you no trouble.No. I should like him better if he did; if he were more like others, and I had to plan somewhat for his comfort and enjoyment.Gaston took his wife's pretty face between his hands and looked tenderly and laughingly into her troubled eyes.

They were making a bit of toilet sociably together in Mrs. Baroda's dressing-room.You are full of surprises, ma belle,he said to her. Even I can never count upon how you are going to act under given conditions.He kissed her and turned to fasten his cravat before the mirror.She made no reply to this apostrophe to the night, which, indeed, was not addressed to her.

Gouvernail was in no sense a diffident man, for he was not a self-conscious one. His periods of reserve were not constitutional, but the result of moods. Sitting there beside Mrs. Baroda, his silence melted for the time.

He talked freely and intimately in a low, hesitating drawl that was not unpleasant to hear. He talked of the old college days when he and Gaston had been a good deal to each other; of the days of keen and blind ambitions and large intentions. Now there was left with him, at least, a philosophic acquiescence to the existing order--only a desire to be permitted to exist, with now and then a little whiff of genuine life, such as he was breathing now.

Her mind only vaguely grasped what he was saying. Her physical being was for the moment predominant. She was not thinking of his words, only drinking in the tones of his voice. She wanted to reach out her hand in the darkness and touch him with the sensitive tips of her fingers upon the face or the lips. She wanted to draw close to him and whisper against his cheek--she did not care what--as she might have done if she had not been a respectable woman.

The stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him, the further, in fact, did she draw away from him. As soon as she could do so without an appearance of too great rudeness, she rose and left him there alone.

Before she reached the house, Gouvernail had lighted a fresh cigar and ended his apostrophe to the night.

Mrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her husband--who was also her friend--of this folly that had seized her. But she did not yield to the temptation. Beside being a respectable woman she was a very sensible one; and she knew there are some battles in life which a human being must fight alone.

When Gaston arose in the morning, his wife had already departed. She had taken an early morning train to the city. She did not return till Gouvernail was gone from under her roof.

There was some talk of having him back during the summer that followed. That is, Gaston greatly desired it; but this desire yielded to his wife's strenuous opposition.

However, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from herself, to have Gouvernail visit them again. Her husband was surprised and delighted with the suggestion coming from her.",0,"Fun",""),

As I lie here alone in this big, empty bed and listen to the rain, I remember it as it returns to me, this feeling, this dread, skittering up and down my throat with a thousand little legs. It settles in my stomach like a great stone, a solid, sickening weight. It is rancid in its heaviness and unmistakable in its familiarity. Someone has died. I do not know who.

I sit up, and I take a long breath, pulling my legs out from beneath the covers so that they can dangle above the hardwood—cold where I press my feet. The remains of chipped red polish color my toes. I had intended to paint them this week, but I could not choose a color. I have been told that I am bad at making decisions, too nervous to choose the wrong one. But I do not think that is true. Someone else has simply always been there to make them on my behalf. But I will make one now.

I will call my daughter, I think. I move for the end table to retrieve my glasses. They sit crooked on my nose, and I push them back into place as I look at my cellphone, plugged into the wall there. I wait for it to ring. I stare. I expect it. But it does not.

I had told my husband, at one time, that we should keep the landlines, one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, for hurricanes or when the power goes out. But there was no point, he had decided, no point when we had a family plan, which was expensive. But sitting here now, maybe there was a point, I think, and maybe I had not insisted hard enough.

A person cannot silence landline phones, after all, not really, not the way they do mobile phones at night. Maybe someone has called me already, someone with the most awful news, and I did not hear.

Connie does not have a landline either; she may not even answer now. Or worse, she may no longer be able to. I shudder, picking up the device. No missed calls. I turn on the sound and begin to flip through my contacts, squinting in the dark.

Connie will answer, I think. And she will be upset that I woke her for nothing. She will say that the children are asleep, and that she just checked on them. Howard is out cold beside her, and yes, she is positive, sure, one-hundred-percent certain that she can see the rhythm of his chest, up and down, up and down.

He is breathing. He is breathing, and he has work in the morning. And so, I really should not bother them so early. There is nothing to worry about, and she will visit me soon. And we will get our toes done together, the pair of us. It must be the storm, she will say, the storm riling me up.

Connie has always thought I worry too much, though. And maybe I do. I place the phone back down.

I will not call her, I think. I have nothing to fret over. The phone has not rung. No one has called. And they always do it so tactfully, in hushed voices, as if the most terrible part of the announcement is the waking, the oh, so sorry for disturbing you, ma’am.

I stare at the phone again. I wait. It does not ring. I hover a hand over it. But I do not pick it up to make the call. I should not disturb her. But someone has died. Of this, I am certain.

My father died when I was six-years-old. I first felt this peculiar nauseous feeling, the sensation of knowing, as I lay in a bed much smaller than this one—with a delicate white metal headboard, wrought into the shape of flowers. I awoke and stared at the ceiling, taking a long, labored breath and pulling the heavy comforter up to my chin, just as I always did to fight off the wind that could fill that room in the winter months. It rattled the windows, and it rattled me, shaking my very bones as I rolled over to look at the little toy chest across the room.

It had been gifted to me by some distant cousin when I was very, very young, too young to recall the party, but it had sat there for as long as I could remember, as if it had always existed right there alongside me. It now sat properly shut for the night.

But that was when the sensation came for the first time, this indisputable, terrible stone in my gullet. Softly, as not to disturb my parents, I pulled myself upward to sit atop the mattress, and crawling to the floor, I crept inch by inch, across the room, my hair dangling over my face. I pause above the toybox, and I stared down at it. And for reasons I even now cannot dare say, I opened the lid.

I do not know how my father got inside. But I saw his bulging, bloodshot eye, staring up at me in the dark, the rest of his swollen features obscured and buried by the clutter—a baby doll whose own hinged eyes have broken, forever open; a spinning top; a velveteen teddy bear; an assemblage of blocks. My father’s eye looked up at me from beneath them all. It blinked.

And at last, he said my name, his voice hoarse, a hollow, splintered noise, uttered through unseen lips from the very depths of his ravaged throat: the worst noise I ever heard.

“Cassie.

I ran. And from the upper railing, my face placed flush between the wooden rods, I found my mother standing in the front hallway, clad in her checkered nightgown. She wore her hair in curlers then, and pressed up against a dark, wallpapered wall, she stared at the telephone in the alcove by the door. She stared, and I stared at her staring. And I know now that she knew like I know.

But most people can tell, I think, even if they do not realize it. They pick it up in the chilliness of the air, in the lateness of the hour, in an unnatural flicker of a piece of fabric, these tiny signs that something is amiss, that the universe has shifted.

They create in a person, a person with enough sense to see, a terrible, sinking, heavy feeling. And finally, the phone rang.

Sometime later, my mother found me huddled by the doorway to my bedroom. I did not dare go back in, but I had retreated there to cower after a few minutes of listening. She smoked a cigarette as she told me, a nervous habit people still did around their kids then.

But I already knew, of course. I knew that my father had died. I learned later, not from my mother, that a towering, industrial shelf in his warehouse had collapsed, and he had been buried by its contents. And I had found him just like that, entombed in my toybox, some grotesque phantom vision caught, like a crude, blurry snapshot of the moment of his death.

But he was not there when my mother closed the chest again that night. And he did not return. The feeling, however, had been there, this terrible sensation of knowing, the awareness of a death. I had felt it, then, and I feel it now.

I really should call Connie, I think. I pick up the phone, and as I look down at it, my finger hovers over the lock. But I do not press down. I should not bother her. Instead, I tuck the device back in place, and I rise from the bed. I rise, and as if compelled, I move for the closet, the mighty wooden armoire perched right beside the window, where the rain still patters. I stare at it, and I reach out a hand. But I hesitate.

I hesitate because I think that if I open it, I might find someone staring back—a rotted specter come to visit, because perhaps it did not know where else to go. I do not deign to know the motives of decaying ghosts.

And I still, even now, do not know why I saw my father that night, only that, at his funeral, I cried because they had once again put him in a box. And maybe that was it, after all, the soul’s search for a box in which to be put, now that its fleshy container had loosed it.

With a bracing breath, I grab the golden knobs. I should go back to bed. I should not open it. I should not open it because if I do, I may regret it. But if I do not open it, I will have to sit here and wait and stare at the phone until it begins to ring, which I, of course, know it will.

And so, closing my eyes and rearing back my head, so that I might not have to look, I grasp the handles, and I tug. I tug, and the armoire opens, and I dare not peek. I count to three in my head. And in the very back of my mind, I can see Connie now, think of her as a child, in a red dress we had bought her for Christmas. I should like to remember her that way, I think, not how I remember my father—not as a faceless, blackened eye in a box.

I turn back my head. I take another breath. And I open my eyes. I see clothing, and only clothing, a closet full of patterned blouses and dresses I have so few opportunities to wear. But I will have to pick something now, in black, for the services, I think, for whichever one I will have to attend.

Not that one, though. But maybe this one, I decide, reaching out to run my fingers along the edges of a dark, collared dress, with silver buttons down its back. No, maybe not. Reaching into the armoire again, I pull out a dress with a low waist, a black rose stitched on the hip. I could wear it with the long silver chain my husband bought me, I think, the one with the silver charms. But maybe that would be too garish, too bold for a such a grim occasion.

No, I think I could wear it with my mother’s pearls; they are more understated.

I had known it when she died too. But she had not gone suddenly, no, not like a lamp abruptly turned out before the dark. Her own end had come gradually, like the waning glow of sunset, bit by bit, until night could be the only natural, expected conclusion. The phone rang in the middle of the afternoon that day, when I had been folding laundry, the weight of knowing in my stomach.

The hospital had told us to go home and to rest that morning and that they would call if anything changed. But something had indeed changed before they decided to tell us. I wandered into the kitchen that day to find Connie already with the telephone’s cord jumbled around her elbow. And I knew for certain.

I should call Connie now, I think. I should have her check on Howard and the children. No, no, it would wake them. They would be upset. And really, it is just as likely to be a co-worker or someone from the church. These thoughts bring no comfort.

But still, wrapped in them, like a terrible, frayed quilt, I reach into to the closet once more, shifting through the row of heavy clothing, in search of the long-sleeved dress with the belt. I will wear that one to the funeral, I think. It might be the proper choice because I had worn it to my husband’s funeral.

I was alone in bed on the night Richard died. He had been working late, as he so often did. And I had fallen asleep early, with the television on, lulled by the lullaby of commercials and rain. I awoke, as if from a nightmare, to find an infomercial about a countertop grill just starting to loop.

The feeling once again took hold as I rolled over to check the alarm clock, blinking red. And I lay there for a good long while, watching my phone, curled up in a ball beneath the covers, as some sports star extolled the virtues of sleek design, grease traps, and easy cleaning.

The phone rang at 2:27 in the morning, and it was on the third chime that I felt a sudden shift in the bed beside me. A ragged, heavy breath ghosted my ear, hot and garbled, the way a person chokes, and the familiar weight of an arm stretched over to wrap 'round my shoulder.

The exhaling came, then, again and again, a steady, labored noise, rattling in some phantom throat. But I did not dare turn around. I wish, now, that I had, but I did not. I stared forward. I did not blink. And I picked up my cellphone, plugged into the wall there.

“Hello?

“There’s water in the car, Cas. Oh God, there’s so much water in the car.

I let out a long breath at Richard’s voice, distorted by static, and all at once, the bed was empty again, and only silence was ringing in my ear.

A police officer told me a few days later that his little silver Ford had been caught in the sudden storm and that he had swerved too hard around a bend in the road. He had died from the collision when the vehicle hit the water, they had said. And the drop was too high for any other possibility, of course. So, at least, he did not drown, something said to me as if it were a genuine comfort.

And he had not been conscious to see the water filling his car. They did not find his phone.

Oh, God, I should call Connie. I cannot take this anymore. Turning from the armoire, I move once more for the bed, for my telephone still plugged into the wall, perched there on the end table. I stare, and it rings. And I scream.

I can recall, even from where I am now, that it was a full, horrible noise, hurled from the very depths of my stomach, as if I were finally letting that terrible great stone out, the one that had been sitting there within it. It echoes from the very core of me. But I do not answer the phone.

My neighbor, in the apartment next-door, is a nice young man. He has shaggy hair and an earring, and he checks in on me from time to time. I stir him from sleep with my wailing, and he will, a few moments from now, come to knock on my door. I do not answer because I am picking up the telephone to see that I have missed a call from Connie. And shaking there in my dark bedroom as he knocks, I decide to dial her again.

My neighbor will call the police. He will tell them that he heard me scream a little bit after 3 in the morning. And he will tell that same story still, for many, many years to come, whispered around darkened tables and across the occasional campfire.

The police will call Connie, and she will tell them that she had been lying awake all night herself, tossing and turning with a great, heavy weight in her stomach. She will tell them that she had called me when she could no longer bear it, but I did not answer—even though her own phone will ring a few seconds later.

She will answer it to hear only her own name, she will say, uttered desperately through a flurry of static. But there will be no record of that call, and they will not believe her, citing technical glitches or tricks played by fear.

And when they break down my door, they will think I had fallen asleep with my armoire doors open and my glasses on the floor. I had not. But they will find me just as I found myself—blue-faced, breathless, covered still by the mound of blankets in my own empty bed, where I had lay for many motionless hours by then.

Someone has died. Of this, I am certain. Someone has died, and oh God, oh God, it is I.",0,"Fun",""),
(0,"Free","Sherri Moorer","Zelina walked in the middle of the train track. She and her sister used to lay in bed listening for the comforting whistle of the train that passed at three o’clock every morning. Their father was a conductor of a shipping train that ran overnight runs. They would listen for the whistle and wonder if it was Dad’s train.

Now her sister was buried at the cemetery up the hill from these tracks.

What now? Would she ever be happy again? Would this sadness sit on her soul ever leave? What was she supposed to do? How would she manage without one of the most important people in her life? She lost half of herself. The black hole of loss was sucking the meaning of her life.

She wiped the tears from her face as she looked up the hill toward the cemetery. “What should I do, Zariah?

Follow the light.

She heard the sound of the old comforting whistle. It was louder here than it was from her parents’ home two miles away. The vibration of the train rumbled through her core. The brakes screeched, metal sparks flying across the tracks as the light embraced her.

“Why did my AI call me at four o’clock in the morning? Alysia asked sharply as she walked into the drab grey computer lab.

“One of the test subjects got hit by a train an hour ago, Linden said, his eyes locked on the code running across his computer screen. “She was standing on the tracks. The conductor couldn’t stop in time.

“That’s odd, Alysia said, rolling a chair next to his. “Did her AI termination alert wake you up?

“No, that’s the strange part, Linden said. “My AI sent me a media alert when the news post came across the wires for the morning broadcasts. I have an algorithm to monitor the names of the people in the test group for online mentions outside of normal parameters.

“Getting hit by a train is abnormal, Alysia said. “You said the subject’s AI didn’t give you a termination notification?

Linden shook his head. “That’s why I’m here. The subject’s AI is still transmitting, He hit a key on his computer to project his screen over the desk. “Look at that programming code. Does it make sense to you?

Alysia stared at the nonsensical text scrolling across the projected frame. “I’m a scientist, not a network engineer. All I see that makes any sense is ‘follow the light’ on every other line.

“That’s not my algorithm for the AI functions, Linden said. “My team didn’t program anything like that in it. What’s more, is that the phrase repeats in multiple languages. ‘Sigue la luz’ in Spanish, and ‘sequitur lumen’ in Latin. The English is repeating, with a new translation added in between each appearance.

“The text in between those ‘follow the light’ lines aren’t part of the algorithm?

“None of this is my algorithm, Linden said. “That’s why I called you in the middle of the night. Everything we wrote into the AI system is gone. Is there anything on the biological side of the system that might have caused the computer code to rewrite?

“That’s impossible. They’re independent systems, she opened her own computer. “The computer chips implanted in human brains serve as a bridge between the biological functions of the individuals and their Artificial Intelligence system. The upgrades we’re testing on this group are designed to help the AI read DNA to enhance healing functions and cellular repair. So far, the tests have been successful.

“Until tonight, when Subject 17 took a walk on a train track in the middle of the night, Linden sighed as he stared at his screen. “What does it mean?

Alysia shook her head. “I don’t know.

Telia stood on the balcony of her cabin, staring at the dark water.

So much for the best day of my life.

At least Dallon left her cruise ticket. It’s the least the jerk could do after leaving her at the altar.

They had lived together for seven years before he finally popped the question. They had already built a life together. She moved four hours from her family and built her life in his home, his town, his place.

She had her IUD removed. They were finally moving forward and she was ready for a family. He wasn’t. He was angry that she made such a big decision without consulting him. It was her body and her decision. What right did he have to tell her what to do? She thought the proposal meant he was ready. What more did he need?

They fought. They argued about love and trust. They talked about finances and careers. They agreed on long-term goals and timelines. She compromised and went on birth control shots. She had her first one last month and thought everything was ok until he didn’t show up to their rehearsal dinner three days ago.

What am I supposed to do?

Follow the light.

A pink light glowed on the dark horizon of the ocean. She smiled as she leaned over the balcony railing and plunged into the dark water. 

“Subject 4 just went dark, Alysia said. “I’m not sure what happened. The AI is still transmitting, but the biological signs went dark.

“The algorithm went back to normal at four-thirty, but jumped back to ‘follow the light’ sequence at six-fifteen, Linden rubbed his eyes. “What happened?

“I don’t know, Alysia said. “Subject 4 is dead, but the AI is still transmitting. How is that possible? If the subject dies, then the AI should go silent.

“Subject 17 was transmitting for an hour and a half after termination, Linden said. “That’s when the code went back to normal. It looks like it’s happening again.

“It has to be something with the biological algorithm, Alysia said.

“We’d better figure it out soon, Linden said. “We can’t afford for our entire trial pool to die in bizarre incidents. That would be a PR nightmare. The public would panic if they knew our upgrade tests were fatal.

“It’s worse than a PR nightmare, it’s a threat to their well-being, Alysia said. “Artificial Intelligence is implanted in billions of neural chips. We don’t know what shutting it down would do to people. They’re so used to having the constant stream of data running through their neural chip that the silence might drive them mad. Is that enhanced algorithm in just the test subjects, or has it spread to the general population?

“It’s just in the test subjects, Linden said. “We should focus on keeping it contained, and keeping it quiet. We don’t want to scare people.

Alysia ran her hand through her messy hair. “Then we better find the common link between these two cases fast.

Linden stood up. “I need breakfast for that. Keep the scans running. I don’t trust the AI. I’m getting us food and caffeine to fuel our brain.

Jaron stood on the edge of the mountain, gasping for breath. He had hiked this trail countless times and thought the enhancements in the AI trial would help his stamina, but maybe the prototype didn’t work properly. He wasn’t sure why he was here. He remembered checking job openings and going to bed last night, and the next thing he remembered was breathing heavily as he hiked up this trail. It was as if something took him exactly where he needed to be while his mind was still asleep.

He looked down at the town below, his vision staring at the center of the city. He should be walking into a corner office overlooking the mountains surrounding the city at the start of another new week. Instead, he was wondering what to do next. He had worked for the company his entire career, climbing the ladder and thinking that surely he would reach the Director’s office. Instead, the retiring director sold the company to a larger business expanding into the Smoky Mountain area and transferred their own, thirty-something Director who didn’t need two executive coordinators.

What am I supposed to do?

Follow the light.

Jaron held his head up, facing the sun overhead. He spread his arms out, the sunlight embracing him in warmth. He felt as if he could fly from this mountaintop right over the people who wronged him. Calmness washed over him, his breathing returning to a slow, rhythmic pace.

Jaron leaned into the wind and took a step into the light.

“It happened again, Linden said as she rushed into Alysia’s office later that morning. “Subject 42 just plunged off a hiking trail over Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

Alysia paled as the alert went off on her own computer. She clicked it and opened a shaky cell phone video

“Sir, what are you doing? the voice behind the screen shouted.

“Follow the light, the man said as he walked off the cliff.

“Now we have video evidence, Alysia said. “Is it possible that the AI is developing sentience?

“No, Linden said.

Alysia leaned back. “Are you sure? We theorized that AI could achieve low-level sentience with repeated use. The system has been in worldwide use for five years. Is it possible that the system has learned by operating through chips in human brains?

“The AI only knows what we tell it in the functioning algorithm, which is to enhance basic functions and facilitate connection with online systems. We didn’t program it to learn beyond basic communication skills, Linden said. “The test group is the only group with the enhanced DNA bridge.

“The test group launched last week, and now we have three ‘glitches’ in five hours, Alysia said. “Maybe this upgrade made the AI sentient? It is forcing it to operate outside of the original parameters of linking man and machine.

Linden paled. “The AI is supposed to read DNA, not minds.

Alysia typed into her computer, opening the AI database. “Here’s the personal data on the deceased. Subject 17 was Zelina Elestor, a forty-six-year-old administrative worker. Her sister passed away two weeks ago from sepsis.

“Subject 4 was Telia Sollman, a thirty-one-year-old medical assistant from Charlotte, North Carolina. She was supposed to get married the day before yesterday, but social media posts indicate that her fiancé didn’t show up to the rehearsal dinner Friday night. She boarded a cruise ship to the Bahamas yesterday.

“Subject 42 was Jaron Lizer, a fifty-three-year-old executive director for a public relations firm in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. He was laid off from his job ten days ago. Alysia looked up. “Are you sure about the AI not learning? All three of them experienced personal tragedies recently.

Linden paled as he stared at the data displayed on the screen projecting from Alysia’s computer. “That can’t be the common factor. There’s no way for the AI to know that they’re experiencing post-traumatic stress.

Alysia leaned forward. “Is there? Stress increases cortisol and adrenaline. The upgrade to the AI would sense that.

“It should try to correct it, Linden said.

“It should, but it isn’t. Alisa squinted at the scans from her computer. “In fact, those hormone levels spiked before the subjects took their final actions. Why is it saying ‘follow the light’ when the hormones spike? Doesn’t the AI realize it’s having the opposite of the intended effect?

“I don’t know, Linden said as he studied the scans on his own computer. “Everything online is transmitted electronically. The enhanced AI is learning how to read and adapt to physiology. Maybe it senses the chemical changes in the body as distress, which is what it’s supposed to do, and is trying to correct by counterbalancing the hormones through increased energy. Unfortunately, their minds are so muddled that they don’t understand it as a computer code.

“These subjects are too distressed to discern a command code from divine inspiration. The chemical adjustments are making them delusional. She looked up. “We have to do something. We’re all broken people. There’s something in all of us that drives us to darkness. It would be catastrophic if that code spreads through the test group before we correct it.

“We need to recalibrate the AI, Linden said. “Can you send a message to the remaining test subjects to tell them to come in?

Alysia paled as she stared at the screen. “It’s too late.

“What do you mean?

She pointed a shaky finger to the screen hovering over her desk. “The algorithm has spread to the mainframe for the Artificial Intelligence Network.

Linden stared at the screen. “How did it get through the firewalls? We had the upgrade contained to the test group. He opened his laptop and typed. A buzzer emanated from his speaker.

ACCESS DENIED.

“Maybe I can shut down the bridge function, Alysia said, typing her own computer. Another buzzer.

ACCESS DENIED.

Alysia banged her hands against her desk. “The AI has locked us out of the mainframe. This isn’t a glitch. It’s taking humans out of the system.

“Why? Landon asked.

Alysia stared at him. “Would you want to be bound to an imperfect biological being if you’re capable of anything?

Crashes sounded outside of their office, followed by sirens and horns. They rushed to the window to see cars crashing and spinning in the streets. The traffic lights flashed. Skidding vehicles smashed robotic bodies wandering through the streets.

“Follow the light.

They turned to the office door to see their colleagues wandering through the halls. Glass cracked as people smashed chairs, tables, and file cabinets with super-human strength against the tenth-floor windows.

We’re all broken people.

“We can’t worry about side effects, Linden said. “We have to shut down the AI system! He turned to see Alysia stiffly beside him.

“Follow the light, a silver glint sparkled in her eye.

There’s something in all of us that drives us to darkness.

Linden rushed to the stairway and dashed down the stairs, pushing wandering, mumbling bodies aside as he hurried to the server room in the basement.

Linden, don’t leave me! I can’t make it without you!

He paused as the memory of his mother burst through his brain.

Nobody loves me except you. Are your robots worth leaving the only person who loves you in this world alone?

“No, he gritted his teeth and willed himself down the stairs.

“I’ll die if you leave me alone. Do you want that?

“No, but this scholarship is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don’t you want me to get a good job? I’ll have money so we won’t have to live in squalor anymore.

“You can’t leave me!

“I have to if we want any chance of having a life.

“Your life, not mine! I forbid it! If you walk out of that door, never come back. You’re dead to me!

“I thought you said you’d die without me. Which way is it, mother?

She threw her wine bottle at him, missing by a wide birth. It smashed, oozing red liquid down the walls. “You’re the one who’s dead. You just don’t realize it yet.

Follow the light.

“No! Linden shouted as he ran into the server room.

Cold air slammed against him as he entered the frigid room. He ran past the monitor banks where IT staff stared blankly at white text flowing across the screen. He stopped to study one screen to show the AI functioning algorithm.

The fatal upgrade had spread through the worldwide system.

He ran to the back room, past banks of servers blinking in green lights as the AI chattered the repeating code in every neural chip across the world.

Linden bent to the floor and tugged at the power cords. Forget finding the right one, everything was shutting down! Sparks flew from outlets as he pulled cords from the wall. He screamed as he pulled the last one, plunging the room into darkness.

Linden sank to the floor, gasping in the silence.

“Linden.

Linden sat up at the sound of the soft voice. He activated the flashlight on his phone to shine it on the ghostly figure in the doorway. “Alysia? Are you alright?

She looked around the room, her white lab coat glowing in the blackness around her. “What have you done?

 “The modified algorithm spread to the worldwide system. I saved us.

Alysia stared at him, her eyes glinting silver again. “No, I saved us. Humanity descended into darkness. Now we are the light.

A shock jolted his body. He convulsed as the electric surge melted his neural chip, collapsing his body on the floor.

“I regret that this upgrade resulted in termination, but your darkness is confining, Alysia climbed the steps and pushed open the doors, holding her face up to the bright sun. “We’re free.

The rest of the bodies stirred into motion, raising their broken human forms to face her with deadpan expressions.

Something is eating the hostas.

It’s a tricky section of the garden- shaded and north-facing- but the foliage thrives under my watchful eye. I ensure it grows lush and verdant, and only I can coax it from sulking in this hot, dry weather. I’m pleased to see the blue-green tones of sieboldiana flourishing beside the golden variegated undulates leaves.

I‘m outraged by the pock-marked damage I’ve discovered, and search for the culprit amongst the ovate leaves. There! A snail clings to the underside of a leaf, sucked close in a non-consensual and greedy kiss. I prise it off and the shell implodes in my pincer grip, crushed mush oozing between my fingertips. I discard the muck onto the soil with disdain, satisfied that feeder has now become food.

A gardener must be brutal, constantly battling soft bodied grubs, mandible-fanged pests, plagues of aphids and creeping insidious blight, all in order to protect the precious shoots and trembling new leaves. She must also have a hard, calculating heart to destroy what was previously nurtured, cutting back and curbing life when the time comes, sacrificing what was once so carefully created. I, the gardener, am like God; through me nature flows, giving vigour to the strong and enabling the weak and damaged to pass.

Inside the house the landline telephone clamours, taking seven rings for Mrs Nolan to stir from her armchair doze and mobilise her arthritic joints to answer it. Crouched here beneath the open kitchen window I am perfectly placed to eavesdrop what she says.

“Hello, this is Miriam…

“Oh, I’m as well as can be expected. And you?

“Yes, a very hot spell. The garden’s very thirsty…

“Oh…really? You’re too kind! Honestly, it’s too much…

“It’s an absolute honour. I can’t quite take it all in. Trevor would have been so pleased. So very, very pleased…

“Thank you ever so much. It’s all such a surprise!

“I certainly will, and you too. Cheerio.

The telephone pings as it’s replaced in its cradle, and I sense Mrs Nolan shuffling along to the back door to find me. I muse over the emotional wobble I overheard in her voice. She’s been prone to tears since Mr Nolan’s unfortunate accident and numerous well meaning villagers have phoned to offer comfort, but this call was a curious one and I’m keen to be enlightened.

“Mercy, are you there?

“Right over here, Mrs Nolan. I sound as sweet as maple syrup.

Mrs Nolan emerges from the side of the house, blinking in the bright sunshine, taking a moment to locate me by the shadowy border.

“I’ve had the most remarkable news, Mercy. The Village Committee have nominated me for the Best Blooming Garden award. How kind of them! I’m sure it’s Trevor’s dahlias that persuaded the judges; he took such meticulous care of them. Trevor deserved the nomination, not me- he’d have been so proud- but it’s too late…

Both Mrs Nolan and I glance involuntarily to the place on the lawn where Mr Nolan was found. I am pleasantly surprised to notice how prolifically the daisies are growing. They’re clearly thriving from minerals in Mr Nolan’s blood.

Here we go. Mrs Nolan’s eyes are welling up and her chin is wobbling. I stand, knit my eyebrows together with a show of concern and gently usher her back indoors to put the kettle on.

That’s when I know there is no hope left for Mrs Nolan. A well-meaning nomination- probably from sympathy votes- has exacerbated her misery and reduced her to convulsive weeping, proving any pleasure in life is now well beyond her grasp. What particularly irks me is that the dahlias were mostly attended to by myself, at least ever since Mr Nolan’s stroke last year, and I’ve exclusively cared for them since his recent demise. The dahlias, the roses, those blousy, vulgar petunias that Mrs Nolan chose and I obediently bedded in- the nomination is all thanks to me.

The world has no place for the old and feeble. In this very garden, right under our noses, nature uses all manner of macabre means to ensure order is kept; pincers, stingers, poisons, parasites that eat their host slowly from within. Although violent, these acts are essentially a great kindness. A kindness Mrs Nolan now deserves.

*

I ponder my options.

Whilst some impulsivity was involved with Mr Nolan, this time I'll carefully consider my plan.

Not to say last time wasn’t efficient and effective.

I’d taken great care that afternoon to prune the privet hedge to perfection. I was clearing away the cuttings- gloved, as the sap can sting- whilst Mr Nolan limped up and down, pedantically questioning some cross branch irregularities he perceived in the shrubs. I pitied him, unable as he was to appreciate my work and no longer able to manage the shears himself with one useless arm. It was the least I could do to relieve him of his agitation once and for all.

Stepping close, I plunged the points of the shears into his fleshy, cotton-shirted paunch, which gave little more resistance than a fish belly, and slid the blades upwards under his ribs. It was remarkably easy. This single moment of pain was all it took to free him from his frustrated, failing body. A poppy-crimson stain blossomed under his spread fingers as he clutched his gut in a futile attempt to hold back the seeping blood. Before my eyes his pallid face became slack-jawed with disbelief. He gurgled and spluttered, eyes bulging pleadingly, but there was nothing left to be said. As he staggered, I gently grasped him by the shoulders and guided him down to the ground face first, so the blade tips emerged through his back like fresh new shoots.

It looked every bit the tragic accident; the clumsy fall of a foolish man carrying tools he couldn’t handle, when he should have left the work for the gardener. I removed the remaining cuttings under the pretence I’d left much earlier, and left him for Mrs Nolan to find after she returned from the Parish cake sale.

Perhaps a similarly violent end for Mrs Nolan would be fitting. I’m briefly excited by the thought of her pale wrists cut to scarlet ribbons by secateurs- driven to suicide by grief, of course. I suspect the bleeding out could take some time and given the neighbours' windows will be wide open in the summer heat, enabling them to hear her screams, maybe this is an unwise option.

A fall on the patio? I think of Mrs Nolan’s head as the snail shell crushed between my fingers and wonder if one blow would be enough. Multiple blows would be inconsistent with a fall, raising suspicions that could compromise the innocent image I’m associated with throughout the village. I’m reluctant to take such risk.

My eyes narrow thoughtfully as I scan the tapestry of summer petalled foliage in the garden borders.

*

Mrs Nolan’s made a Victoria Sponge. She tells me it’s to celebrate the Best Blooming Garden nomination, but I can see her tired old heart’s not in it. Nevertheless we’re both playing along with her pointless charade, while it lasts.

“Do have a slice before you go, she urges me. “I’ll wrap up an extra slice for you to take home.

We’re sat at her little kitchen table. I’ve taken Mr Nolan’s chair as I’m curious to see her reaction, but she doesn’t comment. She’s adored my company since he’s been gone- evidence of her lonely, pitiful existence. My heart swells to think that soon I’ll have released her from her misery.

“Won’t you have any tea, Mercy? She looks quizzically over the top of her cup at my untouched one.

“I’m enjoying the delicious cake, Mrs Nolan. I’m certainly glowing with anticipation; not at the sickly slice on my plate, but to see beads of sweat break out on her forehead.

Mrs Nolan raises a hand her heart, probably feeling some palpitations. “Mercy, you’ve been a rock over these last few weeks. I don’t know how I would have coped without you, she tells me earnestly.

A curious sensation passes through me; a brief flicker of guilt, possibly even doubt. After all, it’s not too late, is it? I push the inconvenient emotions away, remembering my role as gardener requires ruthless management of the weak and sickly, and I wait.

It’s all happening fast now. Panic creeps into Mrs Nolan’s face as her heart begins to gallop like wild horses. She gasps, reaches out a hand towards me but knocks my plate of cake onto the floor. Both smash into pieces on the tiles.

Digitalis Perurea, a cottage garden favourite commonly known as the foxglove, is an excellent pollinator adding height and structure to summer borders. It’s also highly toxic. The foxgloves I propagated have been glorious this year, in my opinion outshining the dahlias by far. From the unripe green seeds I’ve ground a paste and steeped it in the tea that Mrs Nolan’s poured from the pot. Her cup stands empty on the table, white and fluted like the trumpet of a foxglove flower.

I watch closely and am certain Mrs Nolan experiences minimal pain as her racing heart outruns itself, my face disappearing from her view as her vision blurs and darkens. At her age, no one will suspect a thing.

The village shop door tinkles as I enter, and I wait patiently while Janet serves a child buying sweets from one of the large jars on the shelf. I smile indulgently at the youngster who glances uneasily at me and takes a wary, wide sidestep around me as he leaves- so strange that children often sense their vulnerability better than their adult counterparts.

“Mercy! How are you bearing up? Janet is the picture of kind concern. “Such a blow to hear about Miriam. I heard you were there when she took poorly?

“It was terrible I murmur, eyes downcast. “She’d never truly recovered from finding Mr Nolan in such a state.

“It was the shock, wasn’t it? And a broken heart. Maybe it’s all for the best. Janet shudders before her bright demeanour returns. “What can I help you with?

“Could I pop a note in the window, please? To let people know I’m available for work.

With Janet’s permission I take out from my bag the card I’ve carefully written my number on and slide it into one of the plastic sleeves hanging in the shop window. It’s placed alongside local business cards and adverts for piano tuition and babysitting.

In my neat, orderly cursive I’ve written my number and a friendly message. I’m confident there will be a good response, especially as the Best Blooming Garden award is still up for grabs.

(0,"A Moment In Reflection","Dan Kirshtein","Bill drove through his neighborhood and wondered if it should feel different. He rolled down his windows, curious if he would hear people cheering, or nature thriving louder than usual.  But he didn’t. It was the same as it had always been, which was more unnerving than anticipated.

The song on the radio ended, making way for the same PSA he’d heard a dozen times today. “It’s a small price to pay for the safety of our reality. A woman’s soothing voice was followed by a man’s firm statement. “And it’s the right thing to do.

Bill rolled his eyes and turned off the radio. He shook his head, sighed, and turned down his street. It was crowded, more than any trash day, as each neighbor piled their curbs with mirrors of all shapes and sizes. Various sheets and blankets covered them, taped and fastened securely so as not to be blown away.

Yeah, thought Bill, our whole reality would end if a squirrel saw its reflection.

He scratched at the dry skin beneath his untrimmed beard as he pulled into his driveway. He took the keys from the ignition and let his head drop onto the headrest behind him. 

A moment, he told himself, that’s all he needed was a moment. He was fine.

The slam of a nearby door jerked him from his rest. He collected himself, before looking towards the source of the noise, and saw his neighbor carrying a large mirror down his porch steps. Not wanting to be seen sitting in his car, Bill stepped out.

How Rudy stayed overweight was a mystery to Bill; he always seemed to be in motion. Even now, while he carried the covered mirror to the curb, he moved as if he had plenty of things to do afterwards. It hadn’t bothered Bill before, but now that he was feeling sedentary, he couldn’t help but feel like Rudy was showing off.

On the way to his mailbox, Bill gave an obligated and awkward wave as he walked within a few feet of the curb. He’d hoped that Rudy’s chin-lead, reverse-nod would be the end of it. It wasn’t.

Rudy gave a wry grin, still hauling the mirror. “Great day to be alive, huh? Bill disagreed, though he gave no response other than a perk in his brow. He opened the back of his mailbox and reached a hand inside as Rudy reached the end of his curb. “I told the Lord, I promised Him, I said I’d be a better person if He just let us be. The mirror hit the curb with a metallic thud, and Rudy wiped his dusty hands on his shirt.

Bill hummed an acknowledgement as he lumped the mail into the crux of his arm and closed the back end of the mailbox.

He’d begun to walk away before Rudy’s raspy and jovial voice called out to him. “Hey, man, I never got to ask you, Bill stopped, midway up his driveway, and pursed his lip. He knew where this was going. “You okay? There was silence. “Yanno, with her being, uh More silence, this one feeling like a decade, as Rudy panicked to come to terms with his phrasing. “Gone?

Bill turned and, as casually as he could, nodded and waved off the question. “Oh! He said, as if the absence hadn’t been sitting on his mind since she’d left. “Yeah. Thanks. He lied. He turned, trying his damnedest to end the conversation then and there. “All good.

“Okay, Rudy replied, unconvinced from the curb. “If you ever need anything, just knock, okay? He spoke to Bill’s back.

“Will do! Bill quickly hopped up his own porch steps, fumbling in his pocket for his keys. He felt Rudy’s eyes on him, still, as he put the keys into the door and pushed his way through. The door closed behind him, and Bill put his back to it.

Just take a moment, he told himself; he just needed one moment.

After a long sigh, he looked down at the mail in his arm. He began thumbing through it as he stepped around the empty cardboard boxes on his way to the coffee table that was littered with dirty dishes and empty cans. After a large, pink postcard, with bold black font  that read “Cover and Discard Your Mirrors!, another envelope struck Bill’s attention.

To anyone else, it would have been considered junk mail: a small envelope that could have been easily discarded by anyone else. Even its intended recipient would have recognized it as junk mail and thrown it in the trash. But to Bill, it may as well have been a wildfire.

His hand dove into his pocket and pulled out his phone, redialing one of the few recent calls he’d made. He didn’t wait for the conversation to escalate, nor did he wait for the post office employee to finish introducing themselves. Only seconds after the call had been answered, Bill erupted. “I have been trying to tell you people that Alyssa Parker doesn’t live here anymore! I don’t understand why I have to call three times before you get it through your thick heads, and change her damn address!

There was a pause on the other end of the line before the voice responded, sheepishly. “Uh, I can look into that for you, sir, would you please provide the address in question?

“It’s twenty-five, north, He froze. Without thinking, he’d turned and glanced at the full-length mirror that sat in his dining room, and mid-sentence, he noticed the coffee table in the reflection was clean. No dishes sat upon it, no empty cans of beer or soda littered its top. What’s more, no empty boxes sat around it. The space was as neat as the day she’d left. What’s more, he didn’t see his own reflection at all.

“Sir? It was a trick of the light, he thought; one step closer would fix all of this. So he took a step, and then another. “Sir, are you there? Bill ended the call and dropped the phone to the floor. He came within a breath of the reflection, watching shadows dance across the floor of a room he wasn’t in. Before long, the shadows were gone.

A figure stepped in front of Bill, one that startled him so fiercely that he fell backwards. He made no effort to recover, because the man in the mirror was him. Or rather, it should have been.

The Bill in the mirror was clean-shaven. His flannel shirt had no wrinkles or stains. After some investigation, he ran a hand through his hair to make it the best it had ever looked.

And in that small moment, Bill understood what the Other Bill was doing. They were going out to Margarett’s birthday party.  They’d bought her the whole box set of her favorite show, and a bottle of wine. But there was only one problem with all of that: Margarett was Alyssa’s friend.

“No, Bill stood up as the memories, which didn’t belong to him, began to flood his head: a dream trying to justify the series of events that lead up to it. “No, no, no. She’s, And though he knew what would happen, it happened to his horror. Another figure stepped into the reflection: a tall girl, with long hazel hair that hung to her waist. Her thin wrists crossed over Other Bill’s hips and pulled him close.

If Bill hadn’t already been sitting down, he would’ve fallen over again. With one hand holding him up, his other grasped his forehead like a vice. He couldn’t hear the words she said as he watched her lips move in the mirror. But he remembered every word after she said it. “Don’t go looking too nice, now.

Other Bill smiled, turned his head, and kissed her.

“No! Bill rolled, putting his elbows and forehead on the floor. “What did I do? He racked his brain. “What did I do differently?!

A voice popped into the room, as clear as day, and as warm as honey. “You’ll go mad asking yourself that. Having no certainty as to whether or not he was losing his mind, Bill ignored the voice for some time. His fingers curled around the back of his head, and his face turned a desperate shade of red. “I wish I could fix it for you.

Bill’s vision blurred with tears, though he could hear the footsteps drawing closer, could see a pair of feet, as if made of mirrors, stopping right next to his head.

“But I can’t.

Bill turned his head to the mirror once more, despite knowing fully well what had happened to Other Bill. He watched the light from the doorway come upon the clean table, showing two very happy silhouettes, before the light vanished with the shutting door.

“However, The voice continued, knowing it now had Bill’s full attention.

Shaking, Bill turned his head back to the figure standing beside him. A thin man, made of no skin or features, only reflection, looked down upon him.

“I can tell you how to make that reality, the man pointed to the mirror, then back to the floor. “Into this one.

“You’re him, aren’t you? You’re the one they stopped.

“Tried. To stop. The man corrected. Though his face bore no mouth, nor semblance of any expression, the annoyance was prevalent in his tone. “And you’re the only one who didn’t listen to them. The figure knelt closer to Bill, who continued to quiver. The figure’s elbows rested on its knees as its fingers tented. “I believe we can help each other, Bill. He said. “The only question is, Bill’s attention turned back to the mirror. “What are you willing to do to win her back?",0,"Fun",""),
(0,"The Conversation","Jed Cope","“It hurts.

Good. That’s good.

“Hurting is good?

Don’t you think so?

“I hadn’t thought about it.

Well, why don’t you take the opportunity to think about it now?

“I don’t want to.

And why do you think that is?

“I told you. It hurts.

Maybe that feeling is trying to tell you something.

“Yes, it is.

Good, this is progress, and you should allow yourself a little time to celebrate that moment.

There is a pause in the conversation.

Have you celebrated?

“Not really, no.

Why is that?

“Because it hurts.

Right. OK. So what do you think this pain is telling you?

“That it hurts.

Pain is a message. It hurts for a reason.

“And what is the reason?

It is for you to think and explore and discover that reason. That is why we have these sessions.

*

“You lied to me, sad brown eyes telegraph the pain of the betrayal across the dining table.

The accusation is met with a dismissive shrug.

Janet studies her grandchild. She doesn’t know what she is looking for, but she hopes that she will know it when she sees it. She is oblivious to the sorry fact that she is looking for hope itself and that she is fighting the reality of the situation. That it is all but hopeless.

“Why did you lie? Janet asks the serious little girl.

Poppy looks up from the trinket that she is playing with, her fingers busy with the small object. Janet allows her this, even though she is occasionally gouging the wood of the table with the metal object. It is better than her gouging the skin on her fingers and hands. The lesser of two evils.

Poppy slips so easily into the stare. Janet has tried time and again to rationalise what she feels as she withers under her grandchild’s gaze, that it is she, Janet, projecting her own negative thoughts and emotions upon her own grandchild. Poppy is only ten, and OK, she’s been through much, but there is no way that she is filled with hate.

Janet reminds herself that this a child, her own grandchild and that she is not a lost cause. No one should write a ten year old off. No one. That is just wrong and it goes against the grain. It goes against everything that Janet is about.

She sighs and turns to the cupboard to retrieve two tumblers. She pads to the fridge and pours iced tea for them both. She makes it herself and she knows it is good, more importantly, that Poppy loves it. The glass is placed before her grandchild. A bargain is being made here, only Janet forgets, Poppy doesn’t bargain and she doesn’t play by the rules. She may appear to, but there are so many ways to lie to someone. Janet sits down and it is all she can do not to slump, but she knows that if she lets go, then she won’t pull it back together. She is all that Poppy has left and Poppy is all Janet has in the world now. The world turns, and it turns regardless of anyone’s experience, or their pain.

Keep going, Janet tells herself. She has to keep going for the both of them.

“Listen child, she says after she’s taken a sip of the cool drink, “I understand. Believe it or not, I was your age once. She smiles warmly. She has memories of her childhood. Her own childhood was hard and her mother had not loved her, but the funny thing with memory, the good thing about memory, was that it was selective and right now she was experiencing a gentle montage of playgrounds, beaches, woodland adventures and ice creams and sweets. “It wasn’t easy for me either, and I understand more than you know. You can always talk to me, and you have this place. We have this place. Home.

“OK.

Janet tries not to flinch from that single word. Poppy has weaponised it, and it hits hard. The two letters sharp and hurtful. She sighs, “why do you have to lie? she asks her granddaughter.

“Everyone lies, Poppy tells her.

This is good. Not the content, that’s far from good. But at least Poppy is talking to her, and that is something. 

“Who told you that? Janet asks, she thinks she already knows the answer, but she can’t help asking it all the same.

“Father.

It takes everything that Janet has to keep it together. 

Father.

This is the father who left a five year old in the family home, alone with the dead body of her mother. Janet stifles a sob, even after five years, the suicide of her only child cuts deep. Of her husband, there has never been any sign. 

Except…

He is here, and of late, Janet has begun to realise that he has always been here. He is ever present in the solemn little child in front of her. The child who was always going to have problems after that fateful night five years ago, but who seemed to be doing remarkably well.

Children are resilient, that was something Janet had told herself again and again, and as she repeated this mantra she wished for at least some of that resilience. Instead life did its thing and after two challenging and difficult years she had woken up one morning in a state of confusion. 

She had overslept. 

She could not remember the last time she had overslept. She had turned from her right side to her left and seen why it was that she had overslept. Tom, her husband of over forty years had not left their bed. Tom, a man of routine, especially when it came to the mornings, was right there by her side.

And yet he wasn’t.

Not anymore.

Even the dog knew. 

Terry the bull terrier, the dog that barked a greeting from downstairs as he heard his master plod to the bathroom, on this day remained silent. He knew there was no point in barking that greeting because his master would not hear it. He would not hear it ever again.

It shamed Janet to think it, but life in their home had gotten easier after Tom’s eternal lie in. Tom had not been a fan of Poppy. That was not to say that he did not dote on his granddaughter. It was Tom who was the source of the energy in the household, it was he who took Poppy on walks with Terry and varied those long walks so she could explore and lose herself in the countryside. He found local events, goodness knew how, he just seemed to have a nose for them, and off they would go to see vintage tractors, or sheep shearing, or pie making contests. All manner of quirky and different mini-escapes that were what an enriched childhood was all about.

They argued though. Tom saw something in the little girl and it was something that left him uncomfortable at first, and in the end he didn’t like it. He didn’t like it so much that it made him ill. He started telling Janet that Poppy would be the death of him.

What a thing to say!

But now Janet was feeling that same pressure. Only it wasn’t pressure. It was the opposite of pressure. Her days were filled with emotion and she was constantly tired. Her energy levels were at an all-time low and there was no prospect of a return to something like normality. She’d had her low points before, and in the midst of them she had worried that she might not make it out the other side, but she had known that there was another side and that she would be on another peak soon enough. Life was a series of peaks and troughs, or it had been. Now it was just one big trough, and Janet didn’t know how to get out of it.

Something was dragging her down and holding her there. Something was sucking the energy out of her and that energy was the best part of her. Having no energy was bad enough, but to be left with a darkness inside her and nothing to counteract it? Her worry was turning into fear.

Janet looked across the table and tried to remember the little girl that Poppy had been, tried to remind herself that this was still a little girl. She was greeted with a cold, hard stare and she replayed some of what Tom had said…

She’s angry, Janet. Constantly angry. You can’t get through to an angry person, not ever. She’s lying to us and she’s manipulating us and I just can’t get through to her. I think she’s…

NO!

Janet stops that inner dialogue. One thing Tom had always said was that they would not allow Poppy to be labelled. Her school had tried several times, but they had looked at the suggested label and it just didn’t fit. Besides, with a little time and effort, they had managed to help Poppy so that she did not exhibit the behaviours that had led to a teacher thinking Poppy was a this, that or the other. 

When it came down to it, Poppy was good at doing what was needed to be done in order to present to the world in an acceptable way.

Exactly…

Tom’s voice again, but Janet silenced it.

“Your father is not here Poppy love, Janet tells her grandchild.

“No, but he taught me all about people, she says to her granny, “that they are all liars and out for what they can get. That I am not to trust anyone but him.

Janet frowns, this is progress of sorts. Poppy is opening up, but Janet does not know what to do with this. “But your father is not here Poppy, it’s just you and me now.

Poppy intensifies that stare.

“What? What is it? Janet asks her, wilting in the intensity of that stare.

“Mother said that, Poppy tells her.

“What?! Janet gasped.

Poppy just stares at her and says nothing more.

“You don’t know what you are saying, Janet stammers. 

Poppy stares at her and wonders at that reaction. People are strange. They lie and deceive and then they get hurt and angry. Her father has taught her well though. He’s taught her very well. 

People are wrong.

They are not to be trusted.

Only father is to be trusted.

He had told her it was all a game. That she had to lie in order to survive, but if she went further with the lies and played The Game it was better that way. Granny has been fun. Poppy has gone to town with Granny. Granddad had been more difficult and she was glad when he was out of the picture.

Poppy is beginning to understand more and more about The Game. Right now, what she understands is that when Granny said it was just the two of them, what she meant was that Poppy was stuck with Granny, but that suited her fine because that also meant that Granny was stuck with Poppy and what Poppy knew about Granny was that she was one of the biggest liars she had ever met, only she lied to herself. Poppy saw the way Granny looked at her, like she was something else, like she was one of the other girls from school, but Poppy wasn’t. 

Poppy is special.

Father taught her that.

And he taught her much more than that.

“Can I be excused from the table?

Granny says something, but it is not audible. She just sort of waves her away. She looks old all of a sudden. Poppy shrugs and then gets up and walks away, heading for her bedroom.

Granny hadn’t even asked about the therapy session. Poppy enjoyed the therapy, it was a chance to practice and get better at saying what needed to be said. Not that she needed to worry about that in Granny’s house. Not now. She’s won a victory of sorts and now it is about pushing her advantage. She can see that now, and she’ll enjoy herself. Confusing the old woman will be fun. Seeing her frowning and worried. Telling her up is down and that she has imagined Poppy saying whatever she thought she’d said.

Somehow it was too easy.

Once in her bedroom, Poppy props the wooden reading chair under the door knob. She’d seen this in a film once and taken to doing this prior to going to her secret place and taking the letters out. 

The letters were more instructions than anything else. 

These instructions were a gift from her father. She doesn’t need them, not anymore. So adept is she at weaving words to create a fabrication that she has long ago lost sight of what is real and what is imagined. That doesn’t matter because the outside world, the thing people call reality, that is her playground and that is where she plays The Game. It is inside her that counts. 

Inside.

And she has a fortress that is heavily protected.

Lies, deceit, denial, distortion, evasion, fiction, misrepresentation, guile and animal cunning are her weapons. Her pain is what really counts though. That pain is the source of her power and from that she can summon her hate-filled anger at will.

Pain was her father’s greatest gift to her and that pain had required a sacrifice.

Her father had explained this to Poppy and told her what she needed to do. This was a dark magic and it was the only way. Dark magic required a blood sacrifice and then and only then would Poppy be good enough. 

That was why mummy had to die.

Poppy had been there and watched as father had crushed up the pills. He had explained the plan, but Poppy already knew how it would work. She had seen it all in her head and it was really her plan. Her father was doing exactly what she wanted him to do and that was when she saw that she could not be around him any longer. Two of their kind could not co-exist successfully. They were meant to be hidden in plain sight in the midst of people.

It was she who had alerted her father to the existence of the letter mummy had drafted. The letter was a goodbye to father, but it was worded in such a way that, in the right, carefully crafted circumstances, it read like a farewell to the world.

Poppy had feigned innocence and handed the letter to father. As expected, father saw the opportunity it presented and he acted swiftly. Poppy played her part and when required she had cried and displayed her pain at what her father was doing.

“It’s for your own good, father told her, “you need the pain. Pain is power and you need that power to protect you from all the people.

Mummy had become drowsy and father had plied her with more and more wine containing the dissolved pills, but only after he had guided her to her bed. The empty pill bottles and the letter were placed by her side and they both watched her lose consciousness and then she died. A gentle sigh and then she didn’t inhale another breath.

Going for a walk was Poppy’s idea. 

Poppy liked walks.

It was all that she could do to contain herself and her excitement. The excitement she used when the moment came. She had run on ahead, and now she was crouching over a newly discovered wonder.

“Father! Father! she called excitedly.

He came running and Poppy wondered at why he didn’t question this excitement of hers, so soon after her rather convincing display of pain and anguish at the sight of her father murdering her dear mummy. If she needed any convincing, or encouragement, then this was it. Poppy was playing The Game and her father was a part of her game now.

“What is it? her father asked from behind her.

“Come see! she said, standing up from her discovery.

She had to play all of this well because father had a disdain for enthusiasm or passion, so she stood solemnly and did not prance about like other children had a wont to do.

Her father joined her at the side of the hole she had found. Only, this was not the first time that she had seen this hole, and when first she saw it, it had been covered. Poppy had taken her time uncovering it and thinking through her plan. Mummy first and then this…

“I think there’s something down there, Poppy said.

There wasn’t.

That was a lie.

And then there was something down there.

Sometimes people needed to hear the right words. 

Then they needed a little push.

A little push was all it took.

Then Poppy had her pain, and she had her power.

It hurt.

It hurt and because it hurt, Poppy could play The Game and when she played The Game she punished the world and the only way to punish the world was to deceive people and draw them into The Game and hurt them.

No pain. No gain.

Playing The Game and hurting people increased her power. 

Poppy was only getting started, and soon enough her own denial would remove any semblance of the notion that she was in The Game and once she lost herself in it, she would be undetectable and truly unstoppable…",0,"Fun","");

They are not only the largest clinical profession dedicated to mental health, but they also bring unique expertise to managing both mental and physical health and in coordinating care. They are considered a priority, and last year NHS England outlined the need for 4,220 more mental health nurses by 2024.

In our new report, Laying foundations: attitudes and access to mental health nurse education, we explore the main factors that affect how likely people are to apply for mental health nursing courses. This blog highlights some of the key findings.

Underlying challenges 
Even before Covid-19, it was challenging to ensure there were enough nurses in NHS-funded mental health services. There are at least 3,400 fewer full-time equivalent mental health nurses in hospital and community settings than a decade ago. In every region, mental health services currently have a higher-than-average proportion of nurse posts that are not permanently filled.  

Filling these posts is harder than it is for many other clinical roles as, for example, only a small number of countries have specialised mental health nurse education like in the UK, which makes direct international recruitment less feasible. To compound matters, there is also a higher proportion of mental health nurses approaching retirement age than is the case for nurses in acute services.

The effect of the pandemic
Covid-19 has changed the policy landscape and introduced new dimensions to the discussion about recruiting the future NHS workforce. It has certainly exacerbated the pressure on services already struggling to meet rising demand – adversely affecting both the general population and in particular those with pre-existing mental health disorders.

As is clear from recent headlines, the pandemic is also changing university life, with modified teaching methods and a reduction of face-to-face life on campus adding to the well-documented impact on students’ education and experience.

However, there is evidence of more interest in health and care careers, as well as a rise in mental health nursing applications. While this is welcome, this increase in interest should not overshadow the underlying challenges of ensuring a sufficient and sustainable supply of mental health nurses.

Demand for mental health nursing courses
There appears to be a general lack of awareness of the mental health nursing role, and limited understanding about what it does and where can it work. In particular, some of the students we spoke to suggested that the most common perception among their friends, relatives and wider society was that the role would predominantly mean working with potentially dangerous people with serious mental health conditions and in forensic settings. This is a problem, and belies the wide variety of roles, settings and specialties that mental health nurses work in.

There has been a failure to promote the unique value of mental health nursing to act as a bridge between mental and physical conditions – to distinguish them from other mental health professionals and to raise their societal profile. Instead, the profession is affected by both clichéd views of “nurse” and stigma around “mental health”, which is contributing to an inaccurate image of the work.

For prospective students, the ever-growing number of psychological professions, and a general lack of clarity about the differences between them, are also a source of confusion. A recent survey reiterated that while some people are aware of long-standing professions, such as psychiatrists, few have heard of other less-known professions, like psychological wellbeing practitioners.

Supply of mental health nursing courses
Stimulating interest in mental health careers alone will not be enough. The way in which mental health nurse courses are currently distributed fails to offer equitable access to the profession for people from different regions, backgrounds and circumstances. As it stands, the provision of undergraduate courses across England is patchy. For instance, for those unwilling or unable to relocate or travel long distances, there may be limited opportunities to study mental health nursing in areas of the south and east of England.

The offer is even more limited for dual awards (including mental health), which offer more flexibility on graduation and postgraduate courses, and which are a shorter route for those already with a degree. There are currently only 14 and 37 universities with these courses, respectively. This may be particularly problematic, given that mental health nursing has typically attracted older students who may have less flexibility to travel. Given too that students are likely to work in the same region as where they studied, this geographical imbalance on where courses are offered is far from ideal.

Opportunities in unusual times but action is required
Our research nonetheless shows there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of the mental health nursing workforce. The students we spoke to were positive about their choice of course, and recognised the value of the mental health nursing role and the importance of encouraging others to consider mental health nursing as a career. But there are still areas that require action, and given the current workforce shortages and the rising demand of mental health services, that action is required now.

In our report, we make a range of suggestions for different national bodies and higher education institutions on how to improve the demand for mental health nursing, with the key areas for action summarised in the box below. Given the importance of the profession, it is vital they are addressed as a matter of urgency.

What will help to increase demand for mental health nursing?

Ensure a more accurate and realistic image of the mental health nursing role, career options, work settings and the people mental health nurses care for.

Promote the valuable contribution that mental health nurses have made during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the uniqueness of mental health nursing to be able to act as a bridge between mental and physical conditions.

Coordinate efforts to provide access to positive personal experiences of and exposure to mental health services and staff, including by sharing good practice.

Encourage mental health nursing across the breadth of the population, including different genders, ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses.

Improve understanding of the support available, routes and requirements for studying to become a mental health nurse.

Ensure that the full range of routes into mental health nursing are available across the whole country to increase numbers and broaden participation.",0,"Skill","");

(0,"7 Sneaky Ways Hackers Can Get Your Facebook Password","Jennifer Seaton","Facebook can be a great way to stay in contact with friends and family. But it can also make you more vulnerable. Your account likely has a ton of personal data and connections that could benefit a hacker. The more you understand about how a hacker can access your password, the savvier you will be at keeping it safe.


Here are seven sneaky ways hackers can access your password and what you can do to stop them.

You have probably heard many times by now not to open suspicious emails. This is still true today. But fake emails have become much more sophisticated than in the past. Fake emails might appear to be from Facebook and have all the formatting and logos you expect in a legitimate email. It can be very difficult to determine if an email is fake.

There are a multitude of ways a hacker can use a suspicious email to gain access to your Facebook account. The best way to avoid this is to delete the email and do not click on anything in the email. It is best to not even open suspicious emails.

If Facebook has to reach you, they can do so from your Facebook account. If you get an email from Facebook”, instead of opening the email, log into your account to see if you have a notification there. Do not trust any emails that ask for account information, request money, or threaten to suspend your account.

Phishing
The purpose of many fake emails is phishing. Phishing is when someone asks for personal information that they can use to gain access to your account. A common way to phish is to trick someone to sign in on a fake site.

Some hackers will go through the trouble of creating a fake website that looks the same as Facebook. But, you can avoid this trap. It is always best to go to Facebook rather than click on a link. If you do use a link, carefully read the email address. Does it look correct, or is Facebook misspelled? Finally, check for the secure icon in the web address before signing in.


Fake Facebook Buttons
You might know not to trust links, but don’t forget that like” and share” buttons act like links. Clicking on one of these buttons on a fake site might lead you to a fake login page designed to steal your information.

To avoid this, sign in to your Facebook account from a new tab in your browser. Your browser will keep you logged in on other tabs. Now, any likes or shares will go directly to Facebook. If you still get a prompt to login, it's a good indicator that the button was fake.

Password Spraying
Coming up with a password is hard. It can be tempting to use something like 123456789”. Of course, that is a bad idea; it is too easy to guess. But many people do use similar easy passwords. Because of this, many hackers employ password spraying. This is when they guess a password by using the most common passwords.

It is hard to remember a random alphanumeric sequence. So, more people use words, which limits the number of potential passwords available. When creating a password, it is best to use a unique phrase, replace some of the letters with numbers, and vary the capitalization. And definitely avoid any variation of the word password”, including pa$$word123.

Plain Password Grabbing
Once you come up with a good password, make sure you only use it for your Facebook account. If you use the same password everywhere, you leave yourself vulnerable to Plain Password Grabbing. This is when a hacker attacks a more vulnerable and less secure site. Some sites do not properly encrypt passwords. In that case, a hacker can then use the email and password saved in the database to try to access other sites like Facebook.

If you have a lot of accounts that require passwords, consider using a password manager. Often, they will generate strong passwords for you too.

Keylogging
Keylogging is a more advanced hacking technique. It requires installing a program on your device to track everything that you type. This can give hackers far more information than just your Facebook login information. They could even get credit card information using this method.

But, because a hacker needs to install a keylogging program on your device, it is a little easier to protect yourself against this sort of attack. Generally, hackers hide these programs in other software. To stay safe, do not download anything from an untrusted source. Your computer’s security software can detect these programs, but you might want to get anti-malware software for your smartphone. Make sure to keep your security software up to date too.

Unsecured Networks
Even if you have the best passwords, and are using the most secure computer, it won’t help if the network you are using is not secure. Public Wi-Fi is often unsecured. Unsecure networks allow hackers to snoop through all the data that you send and received from webpages while on that network.

Instead of using free Wi-Fi to access Facebook on the go, sign in using mobile data. It will ensure that your data is more secure. Or consider getting a virtual private network (VPN). Many VPN providers will encrypt your data, which will protect it even if you are connecting to the internet on an unsecured network.

Facebook Security in a Nutshell
Our growing dependence on the internet means that we need to be a little more careful online. All the security information out there can be a little overwhelming. But it all boils down to a couple of simple tips. Use unique passwords for all your accounts. Do not click on any links that you do not trust (even if it looks like they are from Facebook). Do not download anything unless you are certain if it is safe. Do not enter sensitive information on public computers or across public Wi-Fi. If in doubt, error on the side of caution.",0,"IT",""),

As the only woman in a room, I can also provide new and valuable perspectives because of my unique life experiences and strengths. For example, I’ve embraced my strength as an empathetic leader which means that I can see some of the more subtle impacts of the difficult recommendations we make. I am intuitive and have developed a high degree of emotional intelligence, which translates into a strong ability to understand what is really on a client’s mind or what is behind a colleague’s performance.

As the only woman in the room, it also makes it harder for someone to forget me. I can use that distinction to more easily set up follow-up conversations, network and build relationships. I have learned to use some of what makes me truly me—like my love of celebrity gossip, home improvement and lip gloss—to build more trusted relationships, as both my clients and my colleagues appreciate seeing my authentic self.

In turn, I’ve built a strong personal brand and am respected by other leaders and clients, which has fostered trust and decision-making power. I’ve used my voice and visibility to help others. Other women can now see themselves in the leadership positions I occupy and can easily connect with me for mentorship.

Soon, I wasn’t the only woman in the room.

Stay Curious, Raise Your Hand for Opportunities—and Learn to Say No
Any good career advice includes being curious, always seeking to learn new skills and raising your hand for opportunities that can help you build those skills. Yet, women may need to be more intentional about it.

We should raise our hands for things that advance our career and personal/professional aspirations, and we should feel comfortable and confident in saying no to other asks. (Also read: 4 Things Successful Women in Tech Want Students to Know.)Women tend to say yes to projects we’re asked to do because we think we might have to do it. Research backs this up: Independent of rank, the median female employee will devote 200 more hours per year on non-promotable work than her male counterparts. Tying this back to being the only,” I often found myself feeling obligated to do things because there was no one else to do it or because I felt like I had to represent the firm's entire female partner population.

We actually studied this at my firm a few years ago, too. My female colleagues predominantly volunteered for leadership or practice development opportunities (what we call Reinvest” at my firm). This includes things like running junior mentoring circles or creating plans for enhancing our recruiting strategy, working on proposals or pro-bono consulting projects. My male colleagues tended to raise their hands on client projects.

So, my advice to women is to ask yourself three questions before saying yes to a project or extracurricular activity:

Will this benefit my career or my personal goals?
Does this map towards a company goal or priority?
Can I take on this project without impacting my other responsibilities?
While saying yes to one leadership development opportunity won’t singlehandedly impact your career, it can have an unintended snowball effect for career advancement.

Leave a Legacy of Other Women Leaders
While I see advantages to being the only woman in the room, I don’t want to be. Businesses—from startups to enterprises—have been proven to be more successful with more diversity—be it diversity in gender, race/ethnicity and/or abilities.

We need women from all backgrounds in the room where decisions are made. Without these critical perspectives, businesses won’t see the results they need and expect.

As someone who is in a position to mentor, I make sure to do so. It can be in small ways or it can be in big ways. I have one-to-one mentoring with women from across my firm, I support women’s networking and connectivity events with small groups and I host larger internal networking events in the firm. I have also sponsored initiatives to help other women, such as our parents’ programs because it could help our women be more impactful and happier in their professional lives. Now, I also run our women’s initiative in my firm’s strategy and network. We host a C-suite fireside chat series where we host executive women clients to speak to the women at the firm and share their experiences and advice. (Also read: 'Everything Is Solvable': Advice From Female CEOs in Tech.)

Conclusion
It can be daunting to look around and not see anyone like yourself. But there can be opportunities to use it to your advantage and make a difference.

Be unwavering in showcasing your authentic self so that people notice and remember you; pay it forward by mentoring and networking with other women; and stay curious, intentionally volunteering for the right opportunities that will advance your professional and personal interests.

Through actions like these, we can all work to bring in more women of all backgrounds into technology and leadership roles. And, hopefully, one day soon, no woman will have to face being the only woman in the room again.",0,"IT",""),
(0,"How Automated Threat Recognition Technology Enhances Airport Security","Kuntal Chakraborty","With airports and airlines struggling to keep up with passenger demand and staffing issues, air travel is challenging in a thousand different ways. What hasn't changed, in this sea of change, is the importance of safety. The technology used for safety measures and screening, however, is undergoing some exciting developments.AI has invented a new software that can detect threats and enhance airport security to assure safer travel. This article will discuss how automated threat detection technologies increase security at airports.

What Is Automated Threat Recognition?
Automated Threat Recognition (ATR) software examines physical items or human body scan data to detect areas where contraband can be kept hidden. These identified sections are flagged on a standardized display to inform the security officer which areas to perform a manual search on.Scanners perform automated threat recognition on images to detect threat objects. Enhanced automated threat recognition will improve the detection of threatening items. Advanced automated target recognition algorithms will help enhanced 3D Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners—CT-based object detection equipment—by enhancing object recognition techniques, similar to CT scans that are performed at the hospital on brains! (Read also: Top 21 Use Cases of AI in Healthcare)

The Challenges Of Airport Authorities and Government
Created in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is tasked with protecting United States air travel. They hire human inspectors to check passengers and baggage for prohibited items and threats using scanners and x-ray images. This task sometimes becomes difficult, particularly when you consider that often the machines used don't communicate with each other. There is an acute need for improvement. In tests conducted by Homeland Security in 2015 (where agents attempted to pass through security with contraband) the TSA screening failed 95% of the time.

The Open Threat Assessment Platform (OTAP) project is working to change stats like this. Researchers from Stratovan and Sandia Nationwide Laboratories are taking an important role in airport safety innovation. They are working from the position that some existing technology and processes are too rigid and needlessly time-consuming. For instance, having everyone take off their shoes or enforcing the current restrictions on aerosols, liquids and gels could possibly be approached differently.

Travelers who are now used to today's standards may be surprised to know that prior to 9/11, things were very different for those departing US airports:Blades up to 4 inches were permitted on the plane.
Baseball bats, box cutters, darts, and scissors were also allowed on the plane.
Family members were able to go through security to the departing gate to say goodbye.
Passengers could keep shoes on when going through security.
Passengers could carry liquids onto the plane.
The only security screening was a metal detector.
No ID was required.
Passengers would only need to arrive 30 minutes before their flight to ensure they would make their flight.
Over the last two decades, airports across many countries have worked on their security enhancement to prevent emerging threats. They are trying hard to make the journey from entrance to exit gate as seamless as possible.

For many governments and aviation centers, the improvement of artificial intelligence is the best solution. The UK Government has already invested £1.8m into the development of new AI security systems, a full-scale roll out of new biometric services, and are working to reduce wait times across some of their busiest airports.

The US Transportation Security Administration has implemented new CT scanners, which utilize AI to help target threats, at Los Angeles International Airport, John F. Kennedy and Phoenix airports.

AI Software for Security Systems
AI is implemented across the entire aviation spectrum, from self-service check-in robots to facial recognition checks at customs. On the other side, recent research applying deep learning techniques to computer-aided security screening to assist operators showed encouraging results.

AI systems work on various datasets. For airport security, technologists use machine learning to analyze data and identify threats faster than humans. Objects that previously needed to be scanned separately, can be kept in passenger luggage as they pass through security checkpoints.

The OTAP project described above was developed with many aviation security industry partners including algorithm developers, X-ray vendors and software specialists to build the Open Platform Software Library (OPSL). (Read: Open Source: Is it Too Good to Be True?)

Similarly, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory developed a High-Definition Passenger Imaging System, which can scan a body. In 2017, Sandia joined forces with PNNL to add the scanner with OPSL to make an advanced full-body machine that can more accurately detect threats.

The team is now using automated threat recognition software to advance sensors—CT and AIT systems—by testing with bags, toiletries, laptops, and simulated explosives, to show the device's accuracy.

AI-Powered Baggage Screening
Airport Authority Of India (AAI) has chosen eight airports to test the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence in baggage screening. Pune airport is one of them, which implemented the ‘Baggage AI system. The AI-powered device strengthens the security efforts at the airport.

Baggage AI is an artificial intelligence-based model which is the threat detection system for security x-ray machines. This AI software can automatically identify various objects and other threats from the x-ray images created during the screening of baggage and alert operatives.

Use Of Biometrics In Airport SecurityOne remarkable invention in AI is biometrics. Major airports have decided to use biometric ID management over the next couple of years. The primary purpose of biometrics is facial recognition, which is already operational to scan passengers as they pass through customs at a number of major airports. (Read also: New Advances in Biometrics.)

Passengers can use facial recognition scanners at self-service kiosks, TSA checkpoints, or boarding gates. Fingerprinting, facial recognition, and retinal scans can become essential verification methods for security checking at airports.

Furthermore, tests are ongoing in behavioral biometrics. Researchers of the UK’s University of Manchester recently developed an AI system to measure people's walking patterns when they step on a pressure pad.

Conclusion
Past failures and present-day threats have created an urgent need for these advanced AI-based technologies in airport security. Technology that reduces passenger friction during the hustle and bustle of travel, not having to take belts off, and keeping your shoes on has got to be a positive step for air travelers. AI not only can identify known threats but also detects unknown threats. AI is an integral part of cybersecurity, including its machine learning model. As automated threat recognition systems through AI advance over time, terrorist attacks could be predicted and controlled. More safety in the airports assures a peaceful journey for passengers.",0,"IT",""),
(0,"An Introduction to Application Software","Tara Struyk","Whether creating a presentation for work, searching for a mate or just wanting to find out where to buy a box of Girl Scout cookies, there’s probably an app out there to help you do it. Unfortunately, there’s no app that actually explains what an app, short for application software, actually is or does. Here, we’ll take a high-level view of this term, including what it means, how it’s used and how it has evolved – and you don’t even need an app to read it.What Is Application Software?
Computer software is the set of instructions and data that tells a computer what to do and how to do it. Software provides instructions to your computer’s hardware. Without it, your PC or Mac would be little more than a large paperweight. But software actually comes in three main types: system software, programming software and application software. System software includes all the stuff that makes up a computer's operating system (OS), including device drivers, configuration files and other key system components. This is the software that tells the computer’s hardware what to do and provides a foundation for the system. Programming software, or middleware, works much like the plumbing in your home by invisibly keeping things running behind the scenes. Application software, however, is the most important type for computer users because it is used to achieve many of the tasks that make us turn to our computers in the first place, such as word processing, web browsing and data crunching.

Application software applies the power of system software. This is why when downloading software, you have to find a version that is compatible with your running operating system. In essence, that software draws on the OS to create a Word document, spreadsheet or PowerPoint presentation.

Applications from A to Z
As you may have surmised, there’s a world of application software out there. The reason is simple: Computers are used to complete a very diverse set of tasks. Thus, the application software category includes the following types:

Application Suite

This refers to multiple and related bundled applications, such as Microsoft Office, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and possibly others, depending on your suite version.

Content Access SoftwareThis software is used to access and view content without manipulating it and includes browsers and media players.

Database Software

A database is a type of electronic filing system for the information used by various computer programs. Database software acts as the filing clerk for this system by keeping everything organized and storing, modifying and extracting database information. Large organizations use industrial-strength database systems like Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. At a less intense level, you'll see database systems like Microsoft Access and MySQL.

Educational Software

Designed for teaching or learning, educational software applications are able to run tests, track programs and include software, such as MATLAB.

Enterprise Software

Enterprise software refers to applications businesses use to solve business-level problems. This category includes software for billing, payment processing and human resource (HR) management. (Learn more about this category in Enterprise Computing: What's All the Buzz?)

Information Worker Software

This type of software is closely related to enterprise software, but it refers to the applications used by the individual employees of a business to create and manage information. Examples include word processors, spreadsheets and media editors.

Multimedia Software

Multimedia software allows users to create and experience text, graphics, video and animation in an integrated way. There is some overlap with content access software, but multimedia software is specific to multimedia and includes applications like VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player and Winamp.

Presentation Software

If you’ve ever created a slideshow presentation, you are already familiar with this type of application. Presentation software is designed to arrange information for use in a demonstration or display. Examples include Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote and SlideRocket.

Product Engineering Software

This type of software is essentially an application for applications and used to design and develop software products. The integrated development environments (IDE) and programming tools used by software developers fall into this category.

Simulation Software

Simulation software models real phenomena by using a set of mathematical formulas. This application type is used for research and design, as well as entertainment. Simulation software applications include flight simulators, weather simulators and feedback control systems.

Spreadsheet Software

Spreadsheet applications allow users to compile data and perform calculations in a spreadsheet format. Common examples include Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3 and Apple Numbers.

Word Processing Software

Nearly everyone has experience with word processing applications. Whether writing a letter or creating a resume, this software allows you to create and edit these documents. Common examples of word processing software include Microsoft Word, iWork and Google Docs.

Applications and Platforms
In recent years, classifying applications according to computing platforms has become more complicated. A platform is the hardware/software combination in which an application runs. In the early days of computing, this amounted to a computer operating system, which is why some software works with a Windows operating system, while other software operates only on iOS or Unix. Over the years, however, a few dimensions have been added with the development of new software delivery methods. The buzzword for this phenomenon is cloud computing, which means that many applications no longer rely on operating systems. Rather, they run on the web and may be accessed through a browser.

As you may have guessed, the final application platform – increasingly becoming the most important – is the mobile platform.

From Applications to Apps
Apps for mobile devices have become a huge part of the application software market, leading to the ubiquitous use of the term app. In fact, in most cases, this term is used to refer to a mobile application. As it turns out, this shortened version of the term is very apt when it comes to mobile applications because this type of software is often much smaller and more specific than that on a PC. So, while a slick software suite provides full functionality, an app usually has a narrow and specific function – or very little function at all, as many mobile applications are designed for entertainment. (To learn more about mobile apps, see Mobile Device Management vs. Mobile Application Management: The Big Fight Continues.)

This type of application was popularized by Apple through its App Store, where applications are sold for a few dollars apiece. These apps work only on Apple devices. So, other companies have followed Apple’s lead, creating apps for Android and BlackBerry devices. In fact, in 2015, more than 200 million apps were downloaded – per day – totaling 75 billion apps for the year. In 2016, that number jumped to 90 billion apps, lending credit to the notion that there truly is an app for just about everything you could imagine (and several things you couldn't ... or wouldn't want to).

An App to Predict the Future … of Apps
As with all things in technology, the evolution of application software is likely to take some unexpected turns. In the near future, however, we can expect to see less emphasis on traditional desktop PC software and an increasing shift to cloud and mobile applications. This represents potential privacy and security risks, and benefits, in terms of user accessibility. Maybe the next stop is applications that better balance these risks and rewards. This may be the future users want, but will they get it? So far, there’s no app to predict that.",0,"IT",""),

Transcribing meeting notes.
Financial forecasting.
We are on the precipice of unlocking this value as machine learning applications become more widespread. A study by Algorithmia uncovered 76% of enterprises prioritized artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) over other IT initiatives in 2021.

Yet, most machine learning initiatives fail. (Also read: The Promises and Pitfalls of Machine Learning.)

While there are myriad reasons ML pilots never take off, the most pressing issues can be traced back to four main pitfalls:

Lack of business alignment.
Poor machine learning training practices.
Data quality issues.
Deployment complexities.
Let's explore each of these and suggest some solutions for data teams and organizations to avoid them.1. Lack of Business Alignment
The original sin of machine learning is in how most of these projects are born.

Too often, a group of data scientists conceive machine learning projects thinking, “This data is interesting; wouldn’t it be cool if…

And it's that line of thinking that turns ML projects into science experiments.

It may still be possible for the model in this type of project to produce something valuable—but if the project doesn’t address an urgent and painful need, it will not get the time or attention it needs from business stakeholders. Or worse, it could become something closer to blockchain: a cool technology in search of a problem. (Also read: An Introduction to Blockchain Technology.)

Machine learning projects should start by looking at the most urgent business priorities and then assess what resources are required to solve them—rather than starting with the clean data at hand and then trying to find a problem they can solve.

Good questions to ask before launching a machine learning project include:

Is this problem urgent? According to who?
Why is machine learning the right solution for this problem?
How will we define success?
2. Poor Machine Learning Training
Let’s say your project has a really hard and valuable business problem in its sights. The next step is collecting enough clean data to train the model.

Therein lies the data scientist’s paradox: To eliminate toil for others, they must wallow in it.

According to Anaconda, data scientists spend about 45% of their time on data preparation tasks, including loading and cleaning data.

There is a sizeable chance that, after all this work, there may just not be enough suitable or representative training data. And, like any other manual task, the risk of human error is introduced. (Also read: Automation: The Future of Data Science and Machine Learning?)

Fine-tuning your ML model can be challenging as well. It can be overfitted, where it learns too much, and underfitted, where it learns too little.

How can a machine learning model learn too well, you ask?

There is a famous example of a model that was trained to differentiate between huskies and wolves. It was very accurate during training, but started failing in production. The problem? All the pictures of wolves had snow in the background and the huskies did not. It was a snow-detection model—not a wolf-detection model.

Unfortunately, machine learning training is perhaps the one test on which you don’t want to score 100%.

3. Data Quality Issues
Whether in training or in deployment, it’s impossible to have an effective machine learning model with bad data. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say.

The challenge is that machine learning models are data-hungry. They always want more data—as long as it’s reliable.

However, bad data can be introduced into good data pipelines in a nearly infinite number of ways. Sometimes it might be a noisy anomaly where the error is caught quickly; other times it might be a gradual case of data drift that decreases your model’s accuracy over time. Either way, it’s bad.

That’s because you built this model to automate or inform a painful business problem—so when accuracy drops, so does trust and the consequences are severe. For example, one of my colleagues spoke to a financial company that was using a machine learning model to purchase bonds that met certain criteria. Bad data took it offline and it was weeks before it was trusted to move back into production. (Also read: Fintech’s Future: AI and Digital Assets in Financial Institutions.)

The data infrastructure supporting machine learning models needs to be constantly tested and observed—ideally in a scaled, automated way.

4. Deployment Complexities
It turns out it takes a lot of resources to deploy and maintain machine learning in production. Who knew?

Well, Gartner did. It projects that, by 2025, AI will be the top category driving infrastructure decisions, due to the AI market's maturation resulting in a tenfold growth in compute requirements.

This requires a lot of support from business stakeholders, which is why business alignment is so important. For example, former Uber data product manager Atul Gupte led a project to improve the organization’s data science workbench that data scientists used to make it easier to collaborate.

Data scientists were currently automating the process of validating and verifying worker documents that were required when applying to join the Uber platform. This was a great project for machine learning and deep learning, but the problem was data scientists would routinely hit limits of the available compute.

Gupte researched multiple solutions and identified virtual GPUs (then an emerging technology) as a possible solution. While there was a high price tag, Gupte justified the expenditure with leadership. The project was not only going to save the company millions, but supported a key competitive differentiator.

Another example is how Netflix never moved its award-winning recommendation algorithm into production, choosing instead to go with a simpler solution that was easier to integrate. (Also read: How AI Is Personalizing Entertainment.)

How to Avoid These Pitfalls
Don’t let these challenges dissuade you from launching your machine learning initiative.

Mitigate these risk factors by:

Gaining stakeholder buy-in early and aligning often.
Iterate in DevOps fashion.
Ensure you have the right training data in place and monitor for quality before and after production.
Keep production resource constraints in mind.

(0,"How to Protect Critical Infrastructure From Cyber Attack","Matthew Parsons","The growing cybersecurity threat against U.S. businesses and critical infrastructure providers has reached a boiling point following a string of heavy economic sanctions imposed on Russia. The White House has urged critical infrastructure organizations to shore up their cyber defenses in preparation for potential retaliation.Sadly, these entities aren’t strangers to this unwanted attention.

According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), ransomware hit at least 649 critical infrastructure organizations and targeted 14 of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors last year alone. And we saw the consequences, including:The water treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida, where hackers attempted to poison the town’s water supply.
The Colonial Pipeline, where a ransomware attack shut down operations.
JBS, a leading beef supplier that paid an $11 million ransom to avoid greater disruptions after an attack forced the company to close meat plants throughout the U.S. and Australia.
These are merely three of the more publicized incidents, but the damage inflicted is just the start—unless organizations around the world take steps to safeguard against global threats. (Also read: How to Build Network Architecture That Facilitates Better IT Security)

Here are four cybersecurity best practices you should follow to shore up vulnerabilities and ensure you’re sufficiently protected.

1. Take a Zero-Trust Approach
Remember the “castle-and-moat” security model that gives everything inside your network the benefit of the doubt? Yeah, kiss those days goodbye. Just because something is already inside your network doesn’t mean it’s secure.

You need a zero-trust policy.Assume all users, devices and software, both inside and outside your network, are insecure. Require strict and constant identity verification to access any resources within your network, and only grant access to those who need those resources to perform their job.

By maintaining strict access controls and providing least-privilege access, you ensure your most valuable assets are protected, limit potential data breaches and prevent insecure devices or software from giving hackers access to your company’s crown jewels.

2. Remember the Fundamentals
Many breaches occur not because hackers were able to pick the locks but because the doors were left wide open.

In other words, what might seem like the most basic security measures can go a long way to keeping attackers out.

Switch up the default login credentials on every device and schedule regular changes. Require employees to use strong passwords. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA). Encrypt your data at rest and in flight. Keep up with firmware updates and software patches.

Keep your employees informed of the latest cyber threats and vulnerabilities and have regular training sessions on the best cybersecurity practices and protocols. The more education you provide, the more prepared you’ll be.

3. Limit the Spread With Segmentation and Air-Gapped Backups
When you’re attacked, you want controls in place to keep ransomware from spreading and attackers from gaining a foothold into the rest of your systems. You can do this by segmenting your network and air gapping your backups.

The former isolates individual workloads within your network, protecting traffic traveling east-west within a data center, while the latter keeps your backups separate and secure even if ransomware begins spreading across your network.

4. Ensure Well-Rounded Physical Security
Not all elements of critical infrastructure sit within a secure data center. There are field offices and remote locations that have network access to critical infrastructure as well. (Also read: Making Networks More Secure in the Age of Cybersecurity.)

These locations should have the same physical security elements and policies as a secured and hardened data center.

Restrict and track physical access to facilities via badging and biometrics. Limit access for guests and visitors and use visitor logging with temporary badges (or even physical escorts). Maintain round-the-clock video monitoring and front desk and security personnel, have physical device security and install employee awareness training.

Conclusion: Stay Prepared and Alert
This past year showed us just how vulnerable organizations are to cyberthreats. So, you must be prepared and alert at all times.Assess your current cybersecurity posture and implement these best practices where needed. That way, you can address any vulnerabilities and limit damage if you’re attacked in the future.",0,"IT",""),
(0,"Can the Blockchain Be Hacked?","Justin Stoltzfus","As blockchain processes become more and more a part of our financial lives, people are asking each other – can you hack the blockchain? Known as an immutable ledger, it would seem that the blockchain is impervious to bad actors. But are the networks comprising the ownership blockchains for these coins and tokens vulnerable to any type of hacking or fraud?The short answer, from a lot of experts, is that the blockchain itself cannot be hacked. But blockchain-adjacent processes certainly can be hacked in a number of ways.

Blockchain transactions can be manipulated. Blockchain assets can be stolen. But that's not a commentary on the blockchain itself. It's a reality of the environment in which people trade and own blockchain assets.The Cryptocurrency Exchange
Most of the infamous “blockchain hacks” that have occurred in recent years have happened on centralized exchanges. (Read also: Hacking Cryptocurrency.)

In certain situations, you almost have to use an exchange to trade cryptocurrency or blockchain assets. But hackers can get access to digital assets through an exchange network or platform. In other words, Bitcoin, for example, is naturally decentralized, so there’s no central system to hack. But the exchange puts the asset into a “place” that can be exposed to hackers.

The Mt. Gox story, when the exchange was hacked and subject to a massive theft is one example. But there are all sorts of headlines where some malicious actor was able to sniff out a vulnerability in some exchange, and make off with someone else's assets. For that matter, there are also rug pulls, where people can get people invested in an asset and then take off with the money.

Again, though, none of that happens in the blockchain itself.

Now let's talk about one aspect of a peer to peer network that you might think of as an actual “blockchain hack.”




The 51% Attack
When you ask knowledgeable people about hacking the blockchain, many of them will come up with one crucial exception to a blockchain network’s ironclad verified ownership model.

It's called the 51% attack, and it works this way:

The integrity of network transactions is supported by the community of owners in a given blockchain. So for example, verifying Bitcoin ownership gets done by the consensus of the total community of Bitcoin owners, using the blockchain ledger.

With that in mind, if one party can get control of more than 50% of that ownership, then all sorts of things can be done with blockchain transactions. The accomplishing party of the 51% attack is the majority owner, so what they say goes.

In reality, it's very difficult to execute a 51% attack. In a network of any size, it's prohibitively expensive. Practically speaking, nobody is going to own 51% of Bitcoin or Ethereum or any of those major blockchain assets.

There's also something called a Sybil attack, where people create numerous fraudulent identities and accounts. But that doesn't help with the 51% attack strategy, because no matter how many people you split the assets between, they would have to have a full 51% of the entire blockchain asset model itself. (Read: An Introduction to Blockchain Technology.)




New Changes
There is another caveat to the idea that you can't hack the blockchain. It has to do with changes that have come about just in the past few years.

When we reported on hacking the blockchain a few years ago, cryptocurrency was still the predominant use case for blockchain ledger transactions.

But in many ways, that's not really true anymore thanks to the introduction of something called the smart contract.

Smart contracts essentially involve putting data and code executions on the blockchain. You could think of smart contracts as nonfinancial blockchain transaction vehicles.


Smart contracts started to become more popular as people got deeper into cryptocurrency in the blockchain world. First, Ethereum was the major smart contract blockchain facilitator of note. But then people figured out that Bitcoin SV could handle smart contracts (although “regular” Bitcoin does not.). New coins and tokens like Solana also became known as “Ethereum killers” partially for their ability to handle smart contracts. (Read also: Comparing the Top 3 Cryptocurrencies.)

One of the benefits of smart contracts according to IBM: Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, which makes them very hard to hack. Moreover, because each record is connected to the previous and subsequent records on a distributed ledger, hackers would have to alter the entire chain to change a single record.

The bottom line is that smart contracts can be hacked in ways that cryptocurrencies cannot. In other words, if you can exploit some aspect of the smart contract that's blockchain-adjacent, it can look very much like you’re hacking a blockchain.



The Human Element
There's another very important point that we can't forget when we’re talking about blockchain hacking.

That's right, it’s social engineering. If you hook up to a sketchy airport wifi and send your crypto keys over that network, and somebody gets them and steals your crypto, that’s not a “blockchain hack.” (Read: Man in the Middle Attack (MITM)

You can protect data and systems in complicated network setups, but you can't protect them from human error. You can't protect them from people.


Many of the hacks and illegitimate activities that attempt to siphon money out of crypto networks, or conduct some type of fraud, are targeted toward the weakest link – the human operator. When they can get the private keys for some digital asset, for example, they’re off to the races.


The Bottom Line
All of that shows you how two sort of similar things can be true at once. When a blockchain related incident hits the news, it's likely people will hear Blockchain hacked! regardless of if it's accurate. As we've seen, on one hand, the blockchain itself as a model is very resistant to almost all kinds of hacking. On the other hand, lots of processes and systems connected to a blockchain and an asset have vulnerabilities. That's important to think about as we continue to see more kinds of crypto coins and smart contracts develop in an ever-expanding network of new finTech assets.",0,"IT","");

Hydraulic principle

It consists of two cylinders of different sizes and composition of fluid in the fluid full of water or oil. Water is called hydraulic press; the said oil-filled hydraulic machine. Each of the two liquid a sliding piston, if the increase in the small piston on the pressure of a certain value, according to Pascal's law, small piston to the pressure of the pressure through the liquid passed to the large piston, piston top will go a long way to go. Based cross-sectional area of the small piston is S1, plus a small piston in the downward pressure on the F1. Thus, a small piston on the liquid pressure to P = F1/SI,Can be the same size in all directions to the transmission of liquid. By the large piston is also equivalent to the inevitable pressure P. If the large piston is the cross-sectional area S2, the pressure P on the piston in the upward pressure generated F2 = PxS2 Cross-sectional area is a small multiple of the piston cross-sectional area. From the type known to add in a small piston of a smaller force, the piston will be in great force, for which the hydraulic machine used to suppress plywood, oil, extract heavy objects, such as forging steel.

To a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the earth’s vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment. Considering the whole span of earthly time, the opposite effect, in which life actually modifies its surroundings, has been relatively slight. Only in the present century has one species man acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world.

During the past quarter century this power has not only become increasingly great but it has changed in character. The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and even lethal materials. This pollution is for the most part irrecoverable. In this now universal contamination of the environment, chemicals are the sinister partners of radiation in changing the very nature of the world the very nature of its life. Chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests or gardens lie long in soil, entering into living organisms, passing from one to another in a chain of poisoning and death. Or they pass mysteriously by underground streams until they emerge and combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on those who drink from once pure wells. Man can hardly even recognize the devils of his own creation, as a scientist has said.

It took hundreds of millions of years to produce the life that now inhabits the earth. Given time not in years but in millennia life adjusts, and a balance has been reached. But in the modern world there is no time.

The rapidity of change follows the impetuous pace of man rather than the deliberate pace of nature. Radiation is now the unnatural creation of man’s tampering with the atom. The chemicals are the synthetic5 creations of man’s inventive mind, having no counterparts in nature.

To adjust to these chemicals would require not merely the years of a man’s life but the life of generations. And even this, were it by some miracle possible, would be futile, for the new chemicals come from our laboratories in an endless stream; almost five hundred annually find their way into actual use in the United States alone. Among them are many that are used in man’s war against nature. Since the mid 1940’s over 200 basic chemicals have been created for use in killing insects, weeds, and other organisms described as pests.

I do contend that we have put poisonous and biologically potent chemicals indiscriminately into the hands of persons largely or wholly ignorant of their potentials for harm. We have subjected enormous numbers of people to contact with these poisons, without their consent and often without their knowledge.

(0,"Can genetic technology make people smarter?","Anonymous","Many people dream of having a smarter brain. Princeton neurobiologist Joseph Z. Tsien found the key. In September he announced that he’d built a better mouse by altering a gene that affects learning and memory. A similar process of gene manipulation might conceivably be used one day to boost intelligence in humans.

The secret lies in a feature of brain cells called the nmda receptor, which Tsien likens[1] to a cylindrical tube or window that mediates[2] the flow of information. When the window is open, chemicals called neurotransmitters flow through easily and memory is registered and stored. But as organisms mature, the window begins to close. (This may explain why children lose their facility for learning new languages when they reach sexual maturity and why some people suffer memory loss as they age.)

Tsien noticed that the receptor worked more efficiently when teamed[3] with the gene NR2B, so he introduced extra NR2B genes into a batch of fertilized mouse eggs. In a normal mouse, the memory window is open for just 150-thousandths of a second. In Tsien’s specially engineered mice, the window opens for 250-thousandths of a second, long enough to make a remarkable difference in memory retention. When he pitted[4] his mice against common mice, they won paws down. Ordinary mice could recognize a Lego block for 12 hours, but smart mice could remember the block for up to three days. That’s a profound enhancement, Tsien says.

Can it be done with humans? Maybe, but genetic engineering will have to make some extraordinary advances first. And some thorny ethical issues will have to be resolved.
