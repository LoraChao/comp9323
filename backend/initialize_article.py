Step 1 – Get leadership support  
Taking action for good mental health starts at the top.

Get the support of your leadership or executive team so they can help drive positive change in your organisation. 

Leadership sets the tone, culture and policies across a business, so genuine engagement from the top will drive positive change.  

Get the support of your leadership by:

Step 2 – Consult with your team
Ask your team what changes would better support their health and wellbeing.  

Your workers know best what they need to do their jobs effectively. Talk to them.

It is important to consult with your team throughout the whole process about what workplace factors are affecting them and how you can provide a working environment that supports their mental health and wellbeing at work.

You can do this through:

staff surveys, focus groups, workshops or one-on-one conversations  
regular check-ins on improvements or adjustments for continual improvement
genuine communication with your team regularly and transparently
finding your mental health champions - start up a team of people in your workplace who are passionate about creating a mentally healthy workplace and discuss opportunities to make a difference.
Icon with checklist with green check marks.
Step 3 – Identify factors and analyse data
Often the information needed to understand and identify factors impacting mental health in your workplace already exists or can easily be obtained.  

Take this approach:

continue the consultation process to understand your team's perspective
analyse your human resources data such as unplanned leave, workers compensation claims, access to support services and tools, and reports of bullying and harassment
use our Workplace Pulse Check to help you understand how your workplace is tracking with providing a mentally healthy environment.  It'll give you actions on how to improve
the People at Work toollaunch can also help you identify psychosocial risk factors.
You also need to consider:

the unique factors that the nature of your workplace and the type of work carried out creates
the cumulative effect of work demands on your employees over time.
This data and feedback will help you understand what areas need to be addressed as you form your action plan.

Icon of green numbered list.
Step 4 - Make a plan
The next step is to take the information you’ve gathered and put it into an action plan.

Having your plan documented will help ensure you stay on track, allowing risks to be mitigated and mental ill-health supported.

Your plan should contain specific and achievable initiatives and actions that can be measured and monitored.

Remember to consider the factors that you identified in step 3 and outline actions to manage each one.

Your action plan should focus on these three areas:

Promote good healthkeyboard_arrow_down
Manage risks to mental healthkeyboard_arrow_down

Step 5 – Put your plan into action
Your plan needs to be put into action, not just sit on a shelf.

Your plan and policies will work best when they’re clearly and effectively communicated to everyone in your workplace. 

Be sure to include it in induction training and make sure it’s easily accessible in hard and soft copy.  This helps you continue the consultation throughout the process.

Step 6 – Evaluate and improve
The journey to a mentally healthy workplace is a process of continuous learning, consultation, feedback and improvement.  

Make sure you:

keep a record of all the workplace factors identified and the actions taken to address them. 
check-in with your team all the time – are things improving? Has there been a positive change in culture? What more can be done? 
look at your business data – are you seeing a reduction in unplanned leave or increased productivity?

(0,"Take action to be a mentally healthy workplace","NSW gov","Key information
Mentally healthy workplaces continually promote good mental health and manage risks to mental health.
Safe work practices and a positive work culture are critical to a mentally healthy workplace.
Mentally healthy workplaces encourage workers to seek help early and support recovery at work.
There are simple, practical actions you can take immediately to promote workplace mental health.
Promote good health
Promoting mental health and wellbeing in the workplace can help create a supportive and inclusive culture while also reducing stigma and opening up communication.

Meaningful promotion of mental health must start at the top. All levels of leadership must commit to building and supporting a mentally healthy workplace for all.

There are five key actions you can take to help ensure mental health is top of mind in your workplace.

Talk and listen 
Our day-to-day interactions have the biggest impact on workplace culture. Take opportunities to check in with staff and colleagues. Get to know them and build strong relationships. This will open the door for people to be more comfortable to seek help when needed.

Use regular one-on-one meetings with staff to check in on workloads, expectations, training needs and the requirements of their role. Regular discussion on these topics can prevent issues that cause mental ill-health.

If you notice changes in a team member's performance or behaviour, check in with them. Let them know you've noticed changes and seek to understand what could be going on for them and what they might need support with.

Other ideas to engage staff on mental health topics:

Take opportunities like R U OK? Day and Mental Health month to hold social events, share case studies and promote resources.
Regularly demonstrate a business-wide commitment to a mentally healthy workplace through internal communications, tools and resources.
Train peer support leaders or mental health champions to create a wide network of people for staff to seek support.
Have active systems, policies and procedures
Having systems in place to mitigate risks and ensure success is part of running a profitable business. The same principles apply to creating a mentally healthy workplace and being an employer of choice. 

Having mental health and wellbeing integrated into your safety systems and documented in policies and procedures can help everyone understand the business expectations around behaviour, reporting and support. It also demonstrates your leadership's commitment to staff health and safety.

Mental health policies work best when they are clearly and effectively communicated to everyone.

Make sure that you:

Seek feedback from staff on draft policies to make sure they are easily understood and work for your people.
Share them with your team when they do their induction or when a policy is updated, created or breached.
Make the policies easily accessible to everyone (without people needing to ask for them).
Review your safety systems regularly including your policies and procedures to make sure they keep up with business changes.
Our free one-on-one business coaching can help you create or review these policies.

Support a flexible workplace
By being flexible in the way work is delivered, you will support the needs of your team and create benefits including improved work-life balance, increased productivity, reduced absenteeism and improved morale. 

In some circumstances, employees have a right to requestlaunch flexible working arrangements. 

Flexibility will look different in each workplace, but the aim is to provide your team with options that work best for their personal circumstances and your business needs. 

Flexibility can include: 

different daily or weekly work hours and/or start and finish times 
staggered rosters 
part-time or job share roles 
hybrid working from home and/or remotely. 
Build your flexible workplace by: 

talking to each of your workers to understand what works best for them 
building a flexible working policy that sets out the principles for everyone to follow to ensure consistent and fair access to flexibility   
checking in and reviewing regularly to see if anything can be improved.

Recognise good work
Recognising the efforts and achievements of staff makes them feel that their work is acknowledged and valued. This can lead to higher engagement, increased productivity and positive morale.

Regular discussions on task performance, overall performance reviews, and development planning create opportunities to provide recognition.

You can give recognition through formal or informal rewards. You might consider starting a rewards program, sharing positive feedback, celebrating both individual and team wins, and providing opportunities for career development.

SafeWork NSW has more tips on recognition and rewardlaunch.

Provide training
Workplace mental health training can help you and your team promote and manage wellbeing. It can also help you better understand how to look after yourself and support others at work. 

There are three types of training that support mental health at work: 

Prevention – how to stay mentally well. 
Responding – how to act on warning signs of mental ill-health.
Recovery – how to support people with mental illness to recover. 
Workplace mental health training teaches you how to provide the right support at the right time. 

Choose a workplace mental health training provider that: 

delivers training via a mode of delivery that suits you
delivers training tailored to your business (for example, the factors you need addressed) or your industry
delivers a program that has been proven to achieve results
provides a facilitator who is suitably trained and experienced.

A risk management approach to controlling exposure to factors that are known to impact mental health can ensure staff safety and create a culture that enables staff to bring their best to work.

The following actions should be part of your part of your plan to a creating a mentally healthy workplace.

Have good work design
Good work design is about creating work that is healthy, safe and productive by preventing or reducing the impact of factors or hazards in the workplace. Good work design supports everyone to do their best work, leading to job satisfaction and higher productivity.

To achieve good work design, you should:

Consider what is involved in performing each work task, including who is responsible, who else needs to be involved and the complexity of the task.
Consult with staff doing the work about how the work could best be completed.
Identify any workplace factors that need to be addressed.
Ensure the work is appropriate for your workers’ experience and skills and achievable, given the workload and resources available.
Continually review workloads and resources and consult with your workers on how they manage and perform their jobs.

Review and evaluate work design regularly by asking your employees for feedback.

Review work design when changes occur, for example work from home requirements or organisational changes.

Provide role clarity
Role clarity is about ensuring that everyone in your workplace understands what is expected of them. The also need to understand why and how their work will be assessed and by who.

This helps reduce stress and confusion so everyone can feel productive, motivated and engaged.

Role clarity doesn’t end with providing a job description. It’s about making sure each employee understands:

their job role and requirements
responsibilities and outcomes they must achieve
how their role fits into the business’s overall outcomes and objectives
who they report to.
You should check in regularly with your employees to make sure work expectations are clear and understood. Help them to develop work plans with clear tasks, time-frames and outputs.

You should also regularly give and seek feedback and assess if any training or development could help your employees in their role.

SafeWork NSW has more tips about providing role claritylaunch.

Monitor workload
To help reduce workplace stress, you should monitor the workload of your employees regularly to ensure they are not having to work excess hours to get their work done.

You can do this by:

Discussing individual workloads in one-on-one catch ups.
Encouraging people to discuss workloads at team meetings so tasks can be shared fairly.
Setting realistic work schedules, clearly prioritising tasks and promoting flexibility where possible.
Making adjustments to roles or tasks if needed or starting a roster to prevent fatigue.
Promote a zero tolerance of bullying
Everyone at work can help ensure that bullying does not occur. Workplace bullying includes repeated behaviour like abusive or humiliating comments, aggression or unjustified criticism and complaints. Discrimination and harassment are also behaviours that contribute to bullying.

Make sure your workplace has a zero tolerance for bullying and a workplace anti-bullying policy that is promoted by your leadership and understood by everyone.

There needs to be a clear process for bullying to be reported and responded to quickly.

Prevent violence and aggression
Everyone has the right to work in a workplace where they are physically safe. Violence and aggression at work can cause both physical and psychological injuries to your employees.

Violence and aggression can include physical abuse and assault as well as threats of violent behaviour from clients, members of the public or other workers in your organisation.

You can prevent injuries from violence by:

consulting with your workers to identify risky situations
changing where and how work is done to minimise risks
having policies on acceptable behaviour and how to report incidents of violence if they occur, so they can be investigated.

Build a positive and inclusive culture
Building a positive and inclusive culture helps people feel valued and supported at work, which can increase productivity.

You can do this by:

Encouraging everyone to participate in making decisions about their workplace, for example, through surveys, discussions and workshops.
Encouraging social connection and creating opportunities for colleagues to get to know each other.
Recognising and celebrating diversity and differences. Be respectful. Make everyone feel like they belong and that work is a safe place to be.
Recognising and rewarding staff achievements and hard work helps people feel like their contribution is valued.
Talking about wellbeing and feelings of stress or burnout at work to help reduce stigma. Start the conversation.

Support early help-seeking and recovery
Seeking help early can reduce the impact and severity of poor mental health, and allows your people to be their best. Sometimes people may not notice the changes within themselves or be aware they need help. 

Nearly 1 in 6 workers are experiencing poor mental health at any given time, which means mental ill-health is likely to be in your workplace - whether it's recogised or not. We bring our whole selves to work and most of us will need support at some time. 

Nearly 1 in 6 Australian employees experience mental illness in their lifetime. lifetime.
Know the signs and act early
Good support from managers and colleagues can help people manage stress, encourage them to seek help early and recover at work. 

As a people leader, you don’t have to be a mental health expert to support your team. All it takes is the ability to notice when things aren’t right, starting a conversation to check in, and connecting people to support if they need it.  

If you notice changes in your workers’ productivity, mood, behaviour or appearance, it can be a sign that they need support. 

If you’re concerned, it’s important to act early by starting a conversationlaunch with them and connecting them with support services if they need it.  

Ways you can ensure your workplace is able to provide support include:  

Build a supportive culture with open communication so people feel like they can talk openly when they need to.
Actively promote your workplace counselling service or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). If you don't have these services in your workplace, there are many free support services, tools and resources available. Share these with your team regularly, so they know where to go if they need support.
Sign up for  mental health training with your team so everyone knows how to recognise the signs and act early.
Have peer support or health champions in your workplace, who promote positive behaviour and are trained to recognise early signs of mental illness and connect people to support. 
Learn how to support your team if they are working from home or remotelylaunch. 
Support staff to recover at work
Supporting people living with mental ill-health to recover at work benefits everyone. Workers often recover sooner, it helps retain workers’ skills and experience, creates a positive and inclusive culture, and avoids the cost of recruiting and onboarding new staff.  

How can you support recovery at work?  

Talk – have a conversation with your team member privately about their situation and offer support.  
Plan – discuss, agree, and write down goals for your team member's return to work. Make workplace adjustments to support their mental health at work.
Stay connected – organise to keep in touch regularly and make changes to their plan as needed.  
Create a peer support network
A peer support program enables people to talk to peers who have had similar work or life experience. This is a great early intervention method as people are often more comfortable speaking to their peers as opposed to their manager. 

Peer supporters can be volunteers from your workplace who receive training to use their lived experience of mental ill health, or a peer worker specifically employed based on their personal lived experience plus other skills required for their role. They use their lived experience to provide support, model hope for recovery and connect people to other support if it is needed. 

Train peer supporters with off-the-shelf training programs, or engage an organisational psychologist or workplace wellbeing provider to customise and deliver training tailored for your workplace.

(0,"Mental health","Jenny Davies","Before the onset of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, an estimated one in six adults in England experienced a common mental health condition each week. Inequalities in mental health persisted, with some groups facing poorer mental health and barriers to accessing services. And in England and Wales, suicide was the leading cause of death for people aged 20 to 34 years.

As with all parts of the health system, the pandemic has had a significant impact on mental health services. The number of referrals fell and trusts have reported an increase in the number of people presenting in crisis. Symptoms of common mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, have increased. This raises concerns about a future surge in demand for support from services which were already under strain.

Here at QualityWatch, we’ve been monitoring how the quality of mental health care has changed over time. While some measures, such as waiting times for children and young people with an eating disorder, show an improvement, other measures, such as follow-up care for adults discharged from psychiatric inpatient care, have not improved. A summary of our mental health indicators is shown below. Click on the links for more detailed content and analysis.

Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme
See the indicator >>

The number of referrals to the IAPT programme starting treatment increased from 533,550 in 2011/12 to 1,165,747 in 2019/20. But the number of people starting treatment must still increase considerably if the 2023/24 target of 1.88 million people is to be reached.
Between February and April 2020, following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of referrals to IAPT more than halved and the number of referrals starting treatment fell by 24%. In August 2020 there were 116,102 referrals to IAPT (11% lower than in August 2019) and 79,281 referrals started treatment (12% lower than in August 2019).
The number of people successfully finishing a course of treatment increased between 2012/13 and 2016/17, but since then improvement has stalled. In Q1 2020/21, 167,655 people successfully finished a course of treatment.
The recovery rate increased gradually between Q1 2012/13 and Q4 2018/19, from 46% to 53%. Since then, it has decreased to 50% in Q1 2020/21. The target recovery rate of 50% was first achieved in Q4 2016/17, but has not been met for the past two quarters.
Children and young people with an eating disorder waiting times
See the indicator >>

Between Q1 2016/17 and Q2 2020/21, the percentage of children and young people with an eating disorder starting urgent treatment within one week of referral increased from 65% to 85%.
The percentage of routine/non-urgent cases starting treatment within four weeks of referral increased from 65% in Q1 2016/17 to 90% in Q2 2020/21.
Between Q1 2016/17 and Q1 2020/21, the number of children and young people starting treatment each quarter following an urgent referral fluctuated at around 300. In Q2 2020/21 (July to September 2020), the number of urgent referrals starting treatment increased to 625.
Hospital admissions as a result of self-harm in children and young people
See the indicator >>

Rates of hospital admission as a result of self-harm in children and young people (aged 10-24) are considerably higher for females than males. Between 2012/13 and 2018/19, the rate for females increased from 508 per 100,000 population to 690 per population. Over the same time period, the rate for males fluctuated around 200 admissions per 100,000 population.
In 2018/19, the South West had the highest rate of admissions at 679 per 100,000 population. The rate was lowest in London at 196 per 100,000 population.
Out of area placements
See the indicator >>

An out of area placement occurs when a person with acute mental health needs who requires inpatient care is admitted to a unit that does not form part of their usual network of services.
Between September 2017 and February 2020, the number of inappropriate out of area placements started each month increased from 586 to 665. In March 2020, the number started began to fall reaching a low of 210 in April. This may reflect changes in mental health inpatient care use due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since April, the number started each month has increased and in August, 575 inappropriate out of area placements were started.
In August 2020, there were 50 inappropriate out of area placements that required patients to travel a distance of 300km or greater. There were 140 inappropriate out of area placements that required patients to travel more than 200km but less than 300km.
Follow-up care for adults with mental health problems
See the indicator >>

The national threshold states that at least 95% of patients should be followed up within seven days of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care. This target was consistently met until Q2 2019/20, when performance dropped to 94.5%. In Q3 2019/20, the proportion followed up within seven days increased slightly to 95.5%.
Suicide in mental health service users
See the indicator >>

In 2017, there were 1,216 suicides in England by people who had been in contact with mental health services in the previous 12 months. In Scotland there were 223 patient suicides and in Wales there were 78.
Between 2006 and 2017, the number of suicides by people in contact with mental health services in the previous 12 months increased by 8% in England. The rate of patient suicide, taking into account the rising number of people receiving mental health care, decreased from 98 to 48 suicides per 100,000 mental health service users over the same time period.
International comparisons of mental health outcomes
See the indicator >>

The rate of inpatient suicide in all comparator countries is less than 2 per 1,000 patients. The UK has consistently had one of the lowest rates of inpatient suicide, although internationally comparable data on the quality of mental health care is limited.
The UK’s suicide rate within 30 days of discharge from hospital among patients diagnosed with a mental disorder is consistently the lowest of the comparator countries for which there is available data.
Service users’ experience of community mental health services
See the indicator >>

The Community Mental Health Survey asks service users to rate their overall experience from 0 (very poor) to 10 (very good). In 2020, 19% of service users rated their overall experience as very good and 3% rated their experience as very poor. *
The proportion of Community Mental Health Survey respondents who ‘definitely’ felt they were given enough time to discuss their needs and treatment has decreased over time, from 65% in 2014 to 57% in 2019. In 2020, 59% of respondents felt they were ‘definitely’ given enough time. *
In 2020, 72% of Community Mental Health Survey respondents said they knew who to contact out of hours within the NHS if they had a crisis. *
Of those who knew who to contact out of hours and had tried in the previous 12 months, in 2020 over half (52%) of respondents said that they ‘definitely’ got the help they needed when they tried to make contact. 17% of respondents did not get the help they needed and 2% were not able to make contact. *
Respect and dignity
See the indicator >>

Between 2014 and 2019, the percentage of Community Mental Health Survey respondents who said that they were ‘always’ treated with respect and dignity decreased from 74% to 71%. The proportion who felt that they were not treated with respect and dignity increased slightly from 7% to 8% over the same time period.
In 2020, 73% of respondents felt that they were ‘always’ treated with respect and dignity and 8% felt that they were not. *
Do patients feel involved in decisions about their care?
See the indicator >>

The Community Mental Health Survey asks respondents if they were involved as much as they wanted to be in agreeing what care they receive. Between 2014 and 2019, the proportion of respondents who were ‘definitely’ involved as much as they wanted to be decreased from 56% to 52%.
In 2020, 53% of respondents said they were ‘definitely’ involved as much as they wanted to be and 8% said they were not involved, but wanted to be. *
* Fieldwork for the 2020 Community Mental Health Survey was carried out between February and June. Analysis found that the scale of changes made by services due to the Covid-19 pandemic varied between trusts. Some trusts received the majority of their survey responses before the pandemic, while others received all responses during the lockdown. Therefore, results are not considered comparable to previous years.

Are patients told about medication side effects?

In 2020, less than half (43%) of Community Mental Health Survey respondents said that they were ‘definitely’ told about possible medication side effects. This compares to 44% of Urgent and Emergency Care Survey respondents and only 37% of Adult Inpatient Survey respondents.",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"Striking increase in mental health conditions in children and young people","Anonymous","The proportion of children and young people saying they have a mental health condition has grown six fold in England over two decades and has increased significantly across the whole of Britain in recent years, new research reveals.

In 1995, just 0.8% of 4-24 year olds in England reported a long-standing mental health condition. By 2014 this had increased to 4.8%. Looking across England, Scotland and Wales using data between 2008 and 2014, reports of a mental health condition in England and Scotland, and reports of treatment for one in Wales, grew by 60%, 75% and 41% respectively.

That’s according to the first national-level study in over a decade to investigate trends in mental health problems in children and young people in the UK. Published today in the Psychological Medicine journal, the study is a collaboration between academics at University College London, Imperial College London, Exeter University and the Nuffield Trust. Researchers analysed data from 140,830 participants aged between 4 and 24 years, in 36 national surveys in England, Scotland and Wales over time.

The researchers analysed responses to questions asking children and young people (or parents for the 4-12 year age group) for a yes/no answer on whether they had any ‘long-standing mental health condition’ (any ‘currently treated mental health problem’ in Wales) and compared this to general long-standing health conditions (both physical and mental). They also looked at questions where responses indicated emotional or psychological distress.

In an accompanying blog on the Nuffield Trust website, research lead Dr Dougal Hargreaves says these findings could point to a widening gap between the mental health needs of children and young people and the services available. However, he also argues that the increase in prevalence tracked in this study suggests a greater willingness among children and young people to open up about mental health issues and a better awareness of mental health.

Key findings include:

Between 1995 and 2014 the proportion of children and young people aged 4-24 in England reporting a long-standing mental health condition increased six fold, meaning that by 2014 almost one in twenty children and young people in England reported having a mental health condition.
In 2008, when comparable data from the other two countries was available, 3% of 4-24 year olds in England and 3.7% in Scotland said they had a long-standing mental health condition, with 2.9% of 4-24 year olds in Wales saying they had received treatment. By 2014 these figures had grown to 4.8% in England, 6.5% in Scotland and 4.1% in Wales.
The age group with the biggest increases were young people aged 16-24, with young people in England almost 10 times  more likely to report a long-standing mental health condition in 2014 than in 1995 (5.9% vs. 0.6%).
Young boys aged 4-12 were consistently more likely to report a long-standing mental health condition than young girls. This was true across all countries. There was less of a consistent gender pattern in the 12-15 and 16-24 age groups.
Over the corresponding time period, the prevalence of total long standing conditions (both physical and mental) decreased slightly in England (20.3 to 19.5%,), increased slightly in Scotland (17.6% to 22.0%) and was broadly unchanged in Wales (13.1% vs. 13.5%).
Long-term trends in reported symptoms of mental health problems (as opposed to reports of a long-standing condition) showed no consistent evidence of an increase in emotional distress. However, the most recent evidence (from 2011-2014) showed concerning early signs of worsening emotional or psychological distress among young adults. For example, the odds of reporting above-threshold symptoms of emotional distress increased by 15% per year among young adults in Scotland.
Commenting on the findings, Dr Dougal Hargreaves of Imperial College London and a Visiting Research Analyst at the Nuffield Trust said:

“We know that there is already a growing crisis in the availability of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, with many more children and young people needing treatment than there are services to provide it. Our study suggests that this need is likely to continue to grow in future. Without more radical action to improve access to and funding for CAMHS, as well as a wider strategy to promote positive mental health and wellbeing, we may be letting down some of the most vulnerable in society.

“But it’s not all bad news. The increase in reports of long-standing mental health conditions may also mean that children and young people are more willing to open up about their mental health, suggesting that we have made some progress in reducing the stigma associated with mental ill health.”",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"Improving young people’s mental health care","Dr Rakhee Shah","The recent QualityWatch report on emergency hospital care for children and young people outlined how young people’s use of emergency care has changed over ten years. Overall there has been a 6% increase in hospital emergency admission rates across all children between 2006/7 and 2015/16. However it is important to note that the number of emergency admissions amongst 10-19 year olds actually dropped during the ten year period, indicating that the increase in emergency admissions by children are attributable to the under 10s. Whilst we need to better understand the increase in admissions for children there are also trends that need further exploration for young people. The most notable is that the older age group showed some increases in admissions associated with specific conditions such as abdominal pain and poisoning.

Strikingly, there was a 27% increase in re-admission to hospital within 30 days amongst children and young people admitted for poisoning by other medications and drugs, which is more prevalent in the 10-24 age group. These figures indicate that we may be failing to provide our young people with adequate mental health treatment prior to discharge and, more importantly, failing to provide ongoing support in the community.

The question is why are we failing this particular group? It is clear that one of the reasons is that the clinical thresholds to receive statutory child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are high. It is approximated that the prevalence of mental health problems in young people aged 16-25 is 10%, yet analysis from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey shows that even in those that have severe mental health problems, almost half (46%) were not receiving mental health care.

Second, there is evidence to show that the prevalence of mental health problems such as common mental disorders and self-harm are on the rise, particularly in young women aged 16-24 who have emerged as a high-risk group.

Third, there have been cuts to government-funded early intervention programmes including positive activities for young people, and services for teenage pregnancy, alcohol and drug use, which may be contributing to young people having more severe mental health problems.

In the long term we need to focus on preventing the ‘upstream factors’ that contribute towards mental health problems, which include investing in resilience training in schools, providing access to high-quality education and health services, and decreasing deprivation. We need to ensure that early support services are in place for young people who are identified as being at risk of developing mental health problems, for example for young people presenting with stress and emotional difficulties. These early intervention services will help prevent mental health problems developing in the long term.

Helping today’s patients
However, what needs to be done to help our young people who are currently experiencing mental health problems? There was consensus at the Nuffield Trust roundtable discussion that to reduce the readmission rate amongst children and young people following self-harm would require a whole system approach. It is important to up-skill people who engage with young people on a regular basis such as teachers, school nurses, youth workers, general practitioners, paediatricians, doctors in A&E, and others. These practitioners need to recognise, risk assess and refer young people to mental health services at an earlier stage, which may in the long term reduce the severity of mental health conditions presenting to A&E.

Young people and their parents should be provided with an option to self-refer to a triage service that can assess the severity of the condition and signpost young people to appropriate mental health services. Both young people and parents, if given the option, may present to mental health services earlier prior to symptoms escalating, and be treated more appropriately in the community, reducing A&E attendances.

We must not forget the key role that parents play in supporting and contributing towards successful outcomes for young people with mental health problems. Enabling parents to become part of the solution includes developing parent support groups, developing services where parents can receive more practical advice about how to manage crises to prevent escalation requiring hospitalisation, and providing parents with liaison staff or a case-worker who can guide them on where to get further help.

System pressures
Child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are stretched and the service requires an increased workforce to meet the increasing demand in order to be able to review discharged patients in a timely manner.

One idea debated at the roundtable event was whether changing CAMHS contracts from block to outcomes based payments could potentially incentivise improvements in mental health outcomes for young people. Currently, the majority of CAMHS services are under block contracts, which means that payments are made in advance on a regular basis to provide child and adolescent mental health services both in acute and community settings. Payments are independent of the actual number of patients treated or activity levels, but can be varied based on patient need or historical expenditure.

Although block contracts are predictable, flexible (as payments are not related to one particular activity) and have low transaction costs, they have been criticised for a lack of accountability and transparency. Payment by results (PbR) or outcomes based payments are used by the government to fund child health services in the acute sector and NHS England have stated that they want to move towards evidence-based, outcome-focused improvements in mental health services working in collaboration with children, young people and their families. A consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach is important as we move forward. Those present at the roundtable discussion felt there was potential for an outcomes based payment system to support innovation and introduce new models of care that respond to young people’s needs. It was also recognised that outcomes of CAMHS services are influenced by a complexity of factors and that this also needs to be taken into consideration.

Voluntary sector role
More recently, the emerging role of social prescribing and voluntary organisations in improving outcomes for young people with mental ill-health has come into the spotlight, as research shows that mental health problems can be caused by social and environmental factors. Social prescribing and support services provided by non-medical organisations can play a key role in providing early interventions for young people and their families at risk of developing mental health problems.

Development of new models of mental health care are key to improving mental health outcomes and reducing readmissions to hospital following self-harm for young people, but it is important to ensure young people’s views are at central, enabling services to be more accessible and age-appropriate. Young people, when consulted during a social prescribing project for emotional health and wellbeing in Rochdale, suggested the best forms of emotional support could include a telephone service where they can speak to people, video consultations and informal support signposting to other services. Increased awareness about local non–medical sources of support within the community amongst healthcare professionals, teachers and youth workers is required to appropriately signpost young people with stress and emotional difficulties.

In order to improve young people’s mental health outcomes, in view of limited resources with financial cuts being made in the NHS and other services, now is the time to stop working in silos and come together (government funded sectors and voluntary organisations) to provide strong leadership and advocate at a national level for more investment in whole community approaches.",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"A 'catch 22' for mental health patients’ physical care","Dr Vivek Srivastava","We looked at 552 cases, across 208 hospitals, of patients with mental ill-health admitted to general hospitals with physical illness. We found good quality care in just 46% of cases reviewed. 23.7% had room for improvement in clinical care and 16.1% had room for improvement in the organisation of care. In 11.7% of cases we found a need for improvement in both clinical and organisational aspects of care.

What are the reasons behind this poor care, and what can hospitals do about it?

Only 95 of the 208 hospitals had mandatory training for staff on managing sick patients with mental health conditions. This lack of appropriate training in many cases points to an issue about staff not having the confidence to care for patients with mental ill-health. Once someone is admitted to hospital it is likely to expose any underlying health issues such as a mental health condition, and staff need to have the confidence to deal with it, and have access to hospital mental health services.

We also found that about 19.6% hospitals did not have a liaison psychiatry service. Where the service was available it was staffed at all times of the day in only 50% of hospitals. Additionally, the service did not cover all the emergency areas and wards in 15% of hospitals.

The majority of patients in the cases reviewed (63.6%) were admitted via the hospital Emergency Department (ED), with a significant minority (14.5%) referred by their GP. We found ED notes to be inconsistent in documenting the mental health condition with only 73 patients having it noted out of the 96 cases where it should have been documented. We also found a similar lack of documentation of a patient’s mental health condition in GP referral letters and in the medical clerking on the ward.

It is now accepted that patients with a severe mental health illness develop medical ill health at least a decade earlier in their lives and die 15 to 25 years younger as a consequence. The rise in mortality is associated with conditions like heart disease at a younger age, often linked to their medications, smoking and obesity.

An example that highlights poor physical treatment in primary and secondary care is the failure to provide stop smoking services routinely to people with mental health conditions. Our study found high levels of smoking among the patients we reviewed - over a third (39.7%) were documented as smokers, compared to 19% of adults in the general population. However, only a minority received effective smoking cessation support.

During in-hospital care some patients need one-to-one mental health observations (sometimes called specialling). But, we found it was inadequate in 68% of cases, primarily because it was given to staff members not adequately trained in that role.

After admission, 22.5% of the patients were referred to the liaison psychiatry team, but lack of timely referral in another 10% compromised their care. Also, ward assessment by liaison psychiatry was significantly delayed in 37.2% cases, which adversely impacted on the quality of care for some patients. The most common reason documented for the delay was “the liaison psychiatry team would not attend until the patient was declared medically fit”. This is a ‘catch-22’ because in many cases physical health and mental health are closely linked. NCEPOD has called for the practice to be discouraged in favour of joint assessment and collaborative management of physical and mental health.

One in four of us will suffer a mental health condition in our lives, and we need to take mental healthcare in hospitals as seriously as physical healthcare, and learn how to provide care for the mind and the body.",0,"Mental",""),
(0,"How can we improve access to children’s mental health services?","Lucia Kossarova","A recent report from the Independent Commission on Children and Young People’s Mental Health is the latest in a long string of research drawing attention to the poor state of children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).

What do we know about these problems and what can be done?

Access is patchy
For a start, children and young people often have trouble accessing treatment, information and support for their mental health.

Nearly a quarter of children referred to children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are being turned away. The reason? Their condition is not seen to be serious enough; in some areas their referral is only accepted if the condition has a major impact on “the child’s life such as an inability to attend school or a major breakdown in family relationships”.

We also know that there is wide variation in how long children and young people (CYP) wait to access CAMHS. The median waiting time across all providers is one month for a first appointment and two months until start of the treatment. However, some children and young people may wait as long as six months for a first appointment and 10 months for start of treatment. Late intervention has not only a significant human and social – potentially irreversible – cost on the lives of children, young people and their families, but also a financial one.

Young people don’t know where to turn for help
Secondly, we know that there are very high rates of self-harm in younger people yet, when in crisis, they often don’t know where to seek help.

The 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey found that self-harm has been increasing over time. In 2014 one in five young adults aged 16-24 had self-harmed; young women twice as much as young men (25.7 per cent vs 9.7 per cent). Likewise, at a recent conference, Dudley Youth Health Researchers presented figures from their survey of over a thousand people aged 11-19, and found that almost half (44 per cent) of those surveyed or someone they knew had been affected by self-harm, while 33 per cent had been affected by an eating disorder.

Yet one in five respondents said that they would not know where to seek help or information in these situations. This reflects national statistics. Hospital admissions as a result of self-harm for CYP are on the rise, as are A&E attendances in under 18s with a primary diagnosis of psychiatric condition or intentional self-harm. While these increases may be a good thing – the result of more awareness and more CYP reporting and seeking care – they could also be a signal that CYP don’t know where to turn when they need help early on.

CYP seek help in different ways
Despite the frequent use of the internet and social media, the majority of young people said they would prefer to speak about their health problems face to face – mainly to parents/carers, followed by a doctor and friends. These findings are consistent with those of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey which shows that young people seek help after a suicide attempt in a different way to adults, who were more likely to go to hospital or a specialist service. Therefore the help available has to be based on an understanding of these behaviours and better tailored to the needs of the young.

Surveys have their limitations, but taking their findings together with the nationally available figures is truly worrying. So how do we respond to these challenges?

More funding for CAMHS
One of the biggest barriers to progress in CAMHS identified by an Education Policy Institute (EPI) review was poor staff recruitment, which results in large expenditure on agency staff. Despite the increase in funding to local areas, high agency spending means that any additional funding granted to CAMHS may not ultimately be used for mental health services for CYP at all. 

A greater focus on prevention
However, in spite of funding challenges, there is lots of good work underway that we can learn from. The EPI review provided some excellent recommendations around prevention, early intervention and the need to deliver better treatment. One of the key pillars of early intervention was a stronger focus on health and wellbeing at school and easy access to appropriate care – through drop-ins or self-referral.

More innovative services
There are many passionate professionals, CYP, parents and carers who seem to be getting it right and it is important to celebrate these. For example, the city centre hub called "Pause" in Birmingham – part of Forward Thinking Birmingham – which plans to revolutionise mental health care for CYP by providing a safe, comfortable and supported space for young people to come, sit, relax and access therapy. Hearing from a young person who is a client of "Pause" recently made it clear that relatively simple solutions can have a huge impact on people's lives.

Another great example is the Well Centre in Lambeth, a one-stop-shop drop-in centre (with a youth worker, CAMHS nurse and GPs) for young people with any physical or emotional concern. This service demonstrates the importance of youth-friendly, flexible and accessible services for CYP.

The Nuffield Trust also looked at some of the new (and not-so-new) models of care for CYP earlier this year and found that many of them were providing easy and flexible access to high quality care.

A way forward
National Mental Health Day may have been last month, but for a lot of young people, every day is a ‘mental health day’. Without addressing some of the barriers to treatment – and an urgent look at funding – more children and young people may be denied access to lifelines when they need them the most.

But we don’t have to wait for national policy change or additional funding to take action. We all have a collective duty to help the youngest and most vulnerable in our society. New and innovative models like Pause and the one-stop-shop offer hope on the horizon, and the NHS can learn a lot from these services. However, we can all make a contribution to helping our young by making small changes – every contact counts. ",0,"Mental","");

(0,"What impact has Covid-19 had on mental health services?","Jenny Davies","Since the emergence of the coronavirus (Covid-19), widespread concern has been raised about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on mental health. We’ve updated our QualityWatch mental health indicators, looking at longer term trends in the quality of NHS mental health care. But what has happened during the pandemic so far, and what does this mean for mental health services in the future?

Symptoms of common mental health conditions increased
The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey asked adults about symptoms of depression between June 2019 and March 2020, and again in June 2020. Between June 2019 and March 2020, 10% of adults were experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of depression. In June 2020, this had almost doubled to 19%.

Self-reported feelings of anxiety spiked in adults at the start of the first lockdown in March. Over the summer, as lockdown measures were eased, anxiety fell but consistently remained at a higher level than in 2019. In October and November, levels of anxiety increased very slightly. While the impact of the second lockdown on mental health remains to be seen, this indicates a worrying picture of worsening mental health.Fewer people were able to access services during the first lockdown
While survey data shows an increase in symptoms of common mental health conditions, during the first lockdown fewer people were referred to mental health services.

Treatment and support for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety is provided by the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. Patients with more significant needs are treated by secondary mental health services.

Between February and April 2020, the number of new referrals to IAPT decreased by 61%. The number of referrals to NHS funded secondary mental health, learning disability and autism services decreased by 39% over the same time period.

This corresponds to a considerable fall in the number of GP appointments and referrals during the first lockdown. It may indicate that fewer patients presented at their GP surgery, or that fewer referrals (including self-referrals in the case of IAPT) were made following GP appointments.The severity of cases seen in secondary mental health services changed
Alongside this decrease in the number of referrals, the caseload of patients accessing secondary care services changed. 43% of psychiatrists surveyed in May reported an increase in urgent and emergency cases and 45% said that routine appointments had decreased.

For patients who were able to access secondary mental health care during the pandemic, the way appointments were carried out changed. Face-to-face appointments were replaced with telephone or video appointments, although most staff surveyed in crisis services reported that home visits were continuing where necessary. This is important as remote appointments are not always appropriate or accessible for the most vulnerable patients.

The change in caseload raises concerns that patients were unable to access support until their condition had worsened. Some patients may have put off seeking support due to worries about using NHS care during the pandemic. For others, the switch to remote appointments may have acted as a barrier to accessing services.

What does this mean for mental health services?
Not everyone who experiences symptoms of a mental health condition will need professional support and treatment. However, the increase in symptoms combined with the fall in GP referrals suggests that mental health services will have to prepare for a future surge in demand.

The drivers of this demand can be split into three groups. Firstly, deferred access to care from people who would have been referred with mental health conditions that pre-date the first lockdown. Secondly, deterioration of symptoms among people with existing mental illness. And finally, from people who have developed mental health conditions due to the wider impacts of the pandemic.

Measures implemented to control the spread of the virus, including restrictions on socialising, limit the availability of informal sources of support, such as from social networks and peer support groups. This could place further pressure on formal services.

Mental health services have been underfunded for many years and were under considerable strain before the pandemic. The recent Spending Review announced a welcome £500 million of funding for mental health to address waiting times, expand support to reach more people, and invest in the workforce. However, estimates suggest that the costs associated with the predicted increase in demand could be as much as an extra £1 billion per year.

The impact of lockdown measures on some of the wider determinants of mental health, such as employment and social isolation, are likely continue for many months. As people’s experience of the pandemic has varied widely, existing inequalities in mental health are likely to be exacerbated. Mental health services may continue to feel the effect of the pandemic for a long time.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Will the third Covid-19 wave overwhelm the NHS?","Sarah Scobie","“Protecting the NHS” has been a mantra for the government throughout the pandemic, as it has sought to get the public on board with adhering to repeated lockdowns and restrictions on everyday life.

Covid restrictions in England have been lifted, but it’s clear that Covid is far from over. Although the most recent data shows a more complex picture, case numbers have been soaring. Despite the impact of the vaccine in reducing severe disease, the numbers of people admitted to hospitals and even Covid deaths are increasing.

What does this mean for the NHS? And will protecting the NHS once again need to become the focus of our pandemic response?

Direct effects of Covid-19 on the NHS
Hospital admissions are the most widely reported measure of the impact of Covid – and these are going up, along with the number of Covid patients in hospital. Covid patients spend a median of seven days in hospital, although this may reduce in this wave as the age of patients admitted is lower. But even so, 38% more beds were occupied by Covid patients on 18 July compared with the previous week, and significant numbers of patients are requiring critical care.The rising number of people in hospital beds is not the only manifestation of rising Covid cases.  Surveillance data from GP practices, 111 services and A&E all show increasing demand on health services from more cases of the virus.

While demand is increasing, there are also pressures on the supply side. Staff absences related to Covid doubled from 6,713 to 13,771 between 1 and 30 June this year. These include people off sick with Covid, but also a substantial number who may be self-isolating or caring for children or other dependants who are isolating. 

While Covid cases are high, hospital and clinic capacity is reduced, even without staff shortages. The demands of social distancing to reduce infections mean there are fewer beds available, and separate treatment areas for Covid and non-Covid patients are needed. And teams need to use additional PPE and cleaning of equipment, so it takes longer to deliver care than before the pandemic.

Further, over a third of people who have had Covid report persistent symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks, sometimes referred to as “Long Covid”. Research into long-term Covid symptoms and effective treatments is ongoing, but there is already evidence that hospitalised Covid patients experience higher mortality and increased chances of readmission than other hospitalised patients. One in three patients were readmitted within 140 days, and one in 10 died after leaving hospital.

Indirect pressures
Rising numbers of Covid cases and the direct pressure this is causing are the very last thing the NHS and social care system needs right now.

The disruption caused during the pandemic has left a massive backlog in people needing treatment, along with a significant upheaval in how patients seek care. 

By May this year the waiting list for planned NHS treatment was 5.3 million, the highest since records began – but numbers treated each week have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. The NHS has been tasked with fully resuming services, but this will be difficult to achieve while Covid rates remain high. As well as the factors noted above, patients waiting for complex surgery that might require admission to intensive care are likely to be particularly impacted. Covid patients typically require longer stays in intensive care than surgical patients, so each additional Covid patient admitted can result in several postponed operations.

The backlog of patients waiting for surgery and investigations is putting pressure on primary care teams, to support these patients and manage ongoing symptoms while they wait for treatment. These same teams are also part of the Covid-19 vaccination programme: over a quarter of the 31.6 million appointments with GPs and practice staff in May this year were to deliver Covid vaccines.

There is also increasing pressure on services in the community, for example, to support people at the end of life. During the pandemic a third more people are dying at home, raising concerns about the capacity of community services to provide care and support for patients and families.

Meanwhile, our social care system is not fit for purpose, and this has a direct impact on people needing social care and support at home to manage health problems. Local authorities are receiving increased numbers of requests for support from people waiting for treatment, or after being discharged after a stay in hospital.

The net result of these demand and supply pressures, combined with a resurgence of other infections as people mix more, is unseasonal levels of demand for urgent treatment. In June this year over 2.1 million people attended A&E, the highest number for any June on record.

Will the NHS be overwhelmed?
The NHS went into the pandemic with fewer doctors, nurses and capital assets than health services in comparable countries, and with deteriorating performance – as measured by growing waiting lists and increased time spent for patients to be seen in A&E.

By the second wave the backlog of people waiting for planned treatment, and how long they had waited, had both increased. The NHS worked to maintain urgent treatment, including cancer, but with nearly 30% of hospital beds occupied by Covid patients, other services were severely impacted.  One ameliorating factor last winter was that lockdown and social distancing measures, along with exceptionally high flu vaccine uptake, prevented the circulation of flu and other seasonal illnesses.  But the NHS workforce emerged from the second wave exhausted.

As the third Covid wave gathers pace, it is clear that the NHS and social care system is in a worse state than at the start of previous waves. Demand for urgent care and the backlog of patients waiting for planned treatment are both growing, staff are exhausted, and non-Covid infections are increasing and likely to get worse over this autumn and winter.

So will the NHS be overwhelmed this time?   

Growing numbers of patients mean Covid wards are already being reopened, and planned operations are being cancelled. If hospital cases continue to rise, as expected given the rapid growth in cases, it will once again result in other services being reduced, in and out of hospital. 

In previous waves, the NHS coped partly because patients deferred seeking help, in response to pleas to “protect the NHS”, and in part because lockdowns reduced some other demands and preserved capacity for Covid patients. But now the public is being told to learn to “live with Covid”. Patients will understandably be less tolerant of delays and worsening quality of care, and in the medium term patient survival for cancer and other conditions could get worse.   

While the NHS will prioritise the most urgent treatment to cope with demand during this Covid wave, this will be at a cost in terms of postponed care and poorer outcomes for many.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Beyond Covid-19 wave two: what now for care homes?","Natasha Curry","One of the most sobering numbers to emerge from the first wave of the pandemic was the number of people residing in care homes in England and Wales to have died of or with Covid-19. Between mid-March and mid-June, there were 19,286 deaths of residents of care homes where the virus was mentioned on the death certificate, accounting for 40% of all Covid deaths registered in that period. As described in our accompanying analysis of the most recent mortality data, this is likely to underestimate the true toll, as there were 35,067 excess deaths (deaths above the ‘expected’ number) of care home residents registered in this same period.

This devastating toll prompted calls for urgent action to be taken to better protect those in care homes ahead of subsequent waves. By mid-September, a winter plan for the social care sector had been published and by late October, the rapidly established social care taskforce had set out no fewer than 52 recommendations for protecting the sector in the next wave.

Why were care homes hit so badly in wave one?
The care sector was already in a fragile state going in to the pandemic and was ill-equipped to cope with the sudden tide of infections. Pre-existing workforce shortages, a vast and precarious provider market, long-standing financial shortfalls, and a lack of robust centralised data about who relies on care created a context in which a response to the virus was difficult to coordinate. These pre-existing fault lines were laid bare during the early months of the pandemic. Gaps in knowledge about the sector were also revealed and still persist (one significant gap being that the impact of Covid on those receiving home care remains largely unmeasured and, particularly for people who fund their own care, currently unmeasurable).

A slow and uncoordinated national response led to delays in PPE supplies reaching care staff and in testing being rolled out. The drive to clear hospital beds in the first weeks failed to take account of the reality of the settings into which many people were being discharged. Patients were not always tested before being discharged, and even when their Covid-19 status was known, the discharge wrongly assumed that care homes had the space, staff and resources to effectively isolate Covid-positive residents.

How have care homes fared in wave two?
As the second wave approached, efforts began to roll out faster testing, to deliver more reliable supplies of PPE and to issue timely and consistent advice to the sector, including reducing staff working across multiple care homes. The extension of the infection control fund to late March 2021 (put in place until September 2020 initially) was welcomed, as was the pledge to supply the sector with PPE free of charge during the same period.

These efforts were not without their challenges, however, with reports of delays in testing and concerns about the practicalities of preventing staff working across settings. Severe restrictions on visits continue to be a source of deep distress to residents and families, and a complex balancing act of different risks for care home managers.

Our accompanying analysis of the most recent mortality data shows that, although there has been a sharp uptick in Covid-19 deaths among care home residents in this second wave, the numbers so far have not reached the scale witnessed in the first wave.

Even with a better testing regime, which is likely to be picking up more cases than was possible in the first wave, deaths from or with the virus among care home residents account for 26% of all Covid-related deaths in the period from 31 October until 5 February. A marked improvement from the 40% of the first wave, but this still represents the devastating loss of over 16,000 individual lives so far. Whether the measures taken prevented an even bigger loss of life, and to what extent other factors such as lower occupancy rates played a part, is impossible to say at this stage and warrants further study.*

What now for care homes?
The news that the first dose of the vaccine has now been offered to all care home residents is a relief, but it is not the time to be complacent. There are still many uncertainties about what impact the vaccine will have among the care home community, particularly in light of recent reports of vaccine hesitancy among staff. What is certain is that the need for vigilant infection control, PPE supplies and continued testing will not disappear any time soon. And while some lessons may have been learnt, care homes face tough times ahead.

Concerns around the financial stability of many care homes were raised before the pandemic, and the increased costs of PPE and staff sickness alongside lower occupancy rates have created extreme financial pressures. Although we haven’t yet seen the predicted widespread closure of providers, there is a risk that some care organisations are only just managing with the increased temporary pandemic support from the government.

Much of this support is set to end on 31 March and it is crucial that the care sector isn’t faced with a cliff-edge. The last thing users of care need after a traumatic year is to suffer the distress and disruption of their care home closing. Councils, providers, staff, residents and their families need certainty about what will happen come April.

Beyond that, as we begin to emerge from this pandemic, there is an opportunity to build something positive from the devastation of the last year by building a more sustainable and resilient care system, fit for the 21st century and better able to weather future storms.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Safe delivery? The main challenges for the NHS in delivering the Covid-19 vaccine","Helen Buckingham","From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the world waited with bated breath for news of a protective vaccine. In the end, much like the proverbial buses, when one came along, others followed in rapid succession. Vaccines from both Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca have been licensed for use in the UK, and vaccinations are well underway. The Moderna vaccine has also now been given the green light, although it will still be a few months before it’s available for use. The NHS plans to vaccinate a significant part of the population before Easter.

But what are the challenges for the health service as it delivers the biggest mass vaccination project in its history?

The hurdles ahead
First, there is the logistical challenge. It will be no mean feat to get the right staff in the right place at the right time with the supplies they need, while ensuring that the people they need to vaccinate are also in the same place at the same time.

There are three competing demands on NHS staff. The need to respond to the very considerable pressures caused by Covid itself, the need to keep ‘normal’ NHS services operating as much as possible (including treating the backlog of patients that has built up), and now the need to deliver the vaccination programme. NHS England have acknowledged that these demands cannot be met solely by the existing workforce.

It has been the responsibility of NHS organisations and GP practices to identify premises to deliver the vaccinations. They need to be easy to reach by both staff and the public – and not already being used by the Test and Trace service. They also need to be big enough for everyone to maintain social distancing throughout, while providing storage for the vaccines themselves and also the PPE and other consumables required. As of January 22, vaccinations in England were being delivered from almost 240 hospital sites and over 1,100 community locations, from pharmacies to mass vaccination centres.

A national distribution service has been established to ensure that every site delivering vaccinations receives supplies of the necessary vaccines, consumables and PPE, seven days a week.

While it does feel appropriate that such logistics are coordinated centrally, we must hope that lessons have been learned from the challenges of PPE distribution during the first wave. In these first few weeks of the programme, it does appear that supply of the vaccine at a local level is the main limiting factor for local delivery. There is no evidence as yet of any Brexit-related disruption to imports from Europe impacting the vaccine supply chain, although Pfizer has announced a temporary slow-down in production while their factories are reconfigured.

The Pfizer vaccine also needs to be stored at a temperature of at least -70°C until shortly before use, presenting an additional challenge. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less problematic from this point of view, but there are other challenges to the supply chain. A worldwide shortage of the glass vials in which the vaccine is delivered to sites is one rate-limiting factor to distribution, and a second is the requirement for each individual batch to be assessed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The latter issue is being addressed by the MHRA, but the former is likely to be problematic for some time. 

Getting the message right
The speed of the vaccines’ development has been truly impressive – no vaccine has ever before progressed from the starting blocks to licensing for use within a year.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it appears that throwing vast sums of money and the best expertise in the world at a problem is one way to find a rapid solution. And regulators have worked hard to ensure that they can carry out their safety checks through a ‘rolling review’ process, running in parallel with the clinical trials.

The vaccines’ developers and regulators have given welcome reassurance that no corners were cut around safety in the race to get a vaccine ready. Nonetheless, there is still a significant communications challenge for the NHS to ensure the public are confident to come forward and be vaccinated. Communications leads working at both local and national level have a critical role to play working alongside their clinical colleagues – including in reassuring the public if there is an incident of an adverse reaction to the vaccine.

The MHRA have specific arrangements in place to track any such incidents, with an anticipated incidence of 0.05-0.1%. Because the Covid vaccines will be administered on a large scale, there may well be instances of people who get ill at the same time as having the injection, which may not have a relationship with the actual vaccination.

In fact, within 24 hours of the first Pfizer vaccines being administered, ‘yellow card’ reports were received indicating two serious allergic reactions. Fortunately, communications teams were able to work well with the media to keep these individual incidents in context, and although standard operating procedures were revised, they do not appear to have undermined public confidence in the vaccine programme.

However, there are concerns about the level of uptake of the vaccine among people from ethnic minorities, who appear to be at greater risk of poor outcomes from Covid infections. It is now a requirement to record the ethnicity of those vaccinated, so that any trends and disparities are rapidly identified. Given the concern surrounding the apparent risks for people from BAME communities, it is hard to see why this requirement was not in place from the start of the programme. NHS England is working closely with community leaders to ensure confidence in the vaccination programme, including designating facilities such as mosques as vaccination centres.

A return towards normality?
Many questions have been asked about who will be vaccinated, and when. The Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisations published the priority order for receipt of the Pfizer vaccine in early December, and this was reconfirmed on the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine later in the month.

Most invitations to NHS staff and members of the public are being coordinated locally via NHS employers and GP practices, but a national booking system has also been put in place to support the mass vaccination centres. When called for their vaccination, people are able to make an appointment at a GP practice, a community pharmacy or one of the mass vaccination centres. For people unable to travel, ‘roving teams’ bring the vaccine to them. A second national system has also been established to hold data on who has received the vaccine (the Pinnacle system), which crucially will help to ensure that people receive both doses needed to confer the maximum possible immunity.

It will be critical that information flows smoothly between the national system and local services. Any glitches will impact not only on public confidence, but on the confidence of the health care professionals relied upon to reassure the public. Unfortunately in the early stages of the rollout, the Pinnacle system has experienced system problems, and GP practices have been recording data manually. We must hope that these issues can be addressed rapidly.

The last 10 months have been some of the most difficult the NHS has ever experienced, and it’s also been an extraordinarily tough year for the public. The next few months will not be easy either. But a successful vaccination programme will mean we can all look forward to a return to normality during 2021, and to the human contact that so many people have so desperately missed.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Children and young people’s emergency care during Covid-19: what have we learned?","Dr Elizabeth Fisher","Well before the emergence of Covid-19, an area of interest to us at the Nuffield Trust has been the use of emergency hospital care among children and young people – with suggestions they are more likely to attend A&E “inappropriately” than is the case for other age groups.

In this blog, I look at the patterns of children and young people’s A&E use before and during the pandemic, and discuss what they might tell us about the subject more widely.

Children and young people’s A&E attendances before and during the pandemic
Recent analysis by the Strategy Unit shows significant falls in A&E attendances by people aged 19 and under since Covid-19 started (see chart below).Yet over the same period, there seemingly have not been large-scale or immediate serious consequences – such as significant increases in children going to A&E too late or increased mortality in under 14s. It’s tempting therefore to conclude that, before March, too many parents and young adults might have been using A&E “inappropriately”.

But by how much are those “inappropriate” A&E attendances down since the pandemic started? One way to find out is to look at attendances where nothing abnormal was detected, compared to those that brought a diagnosis of an injury or illness. It reveals that, during the initial stages of the pandemic, A&E attendances where this was recorded dropped to about a third of their normal levels.

However, the same data shows it wasn’t just potentially inappropriate A&E attendances affected – those bringing a diagnosis of a health care problem also went down by the same scale.

Furthermore, A&E attendances by children and young people in 2019 where nothing abnormal was detected accounted for only 7% of all attendances. That is in comparison to 90% of attendances where a problem was diagnosed – indicating that the majority of attendances were for real issues.

Yet that doesn’t tell us whether those issues were significant enough to warrant emergency care, or whether they could have been reasonably dealt with by other forms of care, such as those provided by GP practices and in the community.

One way to determine that would be to look at A&E attendances defined as non-urgent (cases that are not true accidents or emergencies) or standard (cases without immediate danger or distress) – see chart below.This shows that attendances at A&E for less serious cases did drop during the early stages of the pandemic.

But if you also look at A&E attendances deemed to be serious (i.e. urgent or requiring immediate treatment for preservation of life), the decreases are of a similar scale – indicating again it’s not just “inappropriate” care affected.

Attendance rates for clear-cut emergencies – where it will be more obvious to everyone that treatment in A&E is needed – dropped to a lesser degree and have returned to normal levels quicker. Attendances for burns and scalds, for example, did not drop as much during lockdown, and have since returned to the numbers seen last year.

What does this tell us?
Some of the drops in A&E attendances during the pandemic will be due to lockdown and social distancing measures having a beneficial impact on a child or young person’s health – such as respiratory conditions being helped by less road traffic, or school closures meaning viral or bacterial infections haven’t circulated as freely. But that is unlikely to be the full story.

The fact that attendances dropped prior to lockdown, coupled with decreases in attendances for more ‘appropriate’ cases, suggests that parents and individuals also balanced the risks of Covid-19 against other health care risks, while paying heed to widely used messages about “protecting the NHS”.

Unanswered questions
The fact that it’s been a different story for clear-cut emergencies might on one hand not be surprising, but it does pose some interesting questions.

Does it mean that in less clear-cut circumstances, parents and individuals have been more willing to just put up with certain aliments and illnesses and not seek emergency care at all? Were they more comfortable in monitoring conditions rather than seek care, until it became clearer that emergency care was essential or not?

Or were they able to seek other forms of care, without the need to use emergency care?

Unfortunately, we do not know enough about out-of-hospital care to know whether this happened. The recent policy focus for children and young people’s health care services has been on boosting that out-of-hospital care, with a push to age-appropriate care closer to home. It shifts the focus away from A&E on its own, with any reductions in attendances just a benefit of the new focus and one measure of its success.

The past few months, however, offer a unique opportunity to inform the implementation of that policy, as well as the longer-term changes for children and young people’s services outlined in it. Knowing more about what has happened could also have a beneficial impact on new policies such as “call before you walk”, which discourages people attending A&E without an appointment.

If we could determine what parents and young people chose to do during this pandemic rather than access emergency care – while also finding out what they thought about the alternatives, alongside their views on the future service they want – it could help to inform the NHS’s short and longer-term recovery from Covid-19.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Recovering from Covid-19: the international picture","Sarah Reed","We have seen distressing headlines about how Covid-19 has disrupted core NHS services. Has this been the experience of other countries?
The NHS has certainly not been alone in having to make difficult trade-offs and redirect resources in response to the pandemic.

Even the most well-equipped health systems have postponed or cancelled services that are less urgent – to free up capacity for surges in Covid-19 cases and to help keep rates of transmission as low as possible. Germany and the Netherlands, for instance, both went into the pandemic with more doctors, nurses and hospital beds than the UK, and have had less severe outbreaks of the virus, but still deferred elective care during the peak months of the crisis.

Although essential services have been maintained in many health systems, some countries have seen similarly worrying trends of people forgoing care as in the UK – raising concerns more globally about unmet need and the non-Covid health consequences of the pandemic. For example, experts in Germany, Belgium and Sweden have all reported drops in those countries in the numbers of patients presenting to emergency departments or receiving other critical services during the peak Covid period.

This has serious implications for people living with ongoing health conditions and for recovery in each country, and will add to the backlog of issues that health systems will have to address in the pandemic’s wake.

But of course, countries also entered this crisis with very different starting points, and have been impacted by the virus in different ways. It’s those differences that are likely to play out in system recovery – and influence how effectively and quickly health systems are able to resume care for everyone who needs it.

What might the NHS’s path to recovery look like compared to other health systems?
Despite the NHS pursuing many similar strategies to other countries in increasing capacity and in restarting elective care, it is likely to have a slower path to recovery given where it was at the start of the pandemic.

Even if the NHS had responded perfectly to contain and manage Covid-19, it’s plausible to say that recovery would have always been a challenge given the existing pressures on the health service.

The UK met Covid-19 with higher bed occupancy rates and fewer doctors, nurses and capital resources than most other health systems. Parts of the NHS have been working with older buildings and equipment, chronic workforce shortages, and very little slack to scale up activity in a crisis. This is different than in countries like Germany, which has three times as many beds and nearly twice as many nurses per person.

How many resources each country’s health system had at the start of the pandemic will be important when we consider the impact of infection control measures that the NHS and other health systems will now have to implement. Every country severely affected by the coronavirus will be challenged to deliver what it could do previously.

But those capacity concerns in the UK could mean it is more stretched than other countries in addressing the demand that’s built up over the pandemic – which could mean longer waiting times and have devastating consequences for some patients.  

What else might influence how well a system recovers?
The amount of beds, equipment and staff in each health system is only one determinant in system recovery. A host of other factors – many of which are harder to quantify – will also be key to understanding how resilient health systems have been.

These include practical things like testing and tracing capabilities, and availability of personal protective equipment. But they also include how well countries are able to coordinate and make effective decisions across different levels of government and sectors. Other factors, such as how well health systems are able to adapt and maintain any positive changes developed in response to the pandemic, will also matter.

The recovery of health systems will also not happen in a vacuum. Given the way the health and socioeconomic crises of the pandemic are converging, wider government responses to the pandemic will also be critical.

What are some common ways that health systems have built capacity to respond to Covid-19?
Even countries entering the pandemic with relatively greater capacity, such as Germany and the Netherlands, have had to find ways to increase staff and release acute and critical care beds and equipment to treat patients severely affected by the virus.

To quickly mobilise the workforce, a number of countries called upon the help of inactive health care personnel, as well as students close to graduation from medical, nursing and public health programmes. Countries also stretched their existing workforce by moving more staff from part-time to full-time roles, modifying work schedules, and upskilling staff into new roles. Such efforts have also been supported by simplifying registration and hiring processes.

To free up more acute care resources, common approaches have included converting existing wards and theatres into intensive care units, building temporary field hospitals or treatments centres in the community to help triage and manage cases, and adding resources from the private sector.

This all required rapid changes to how care is organised and delivered. It is critical that we learn what’s been positive about some of the system changes, and maintain them for the future.

Where have there been key differences?
A large number of health systems have created designated treatment or diagnostic centres as ‘Covid-19 only’ to further reduce transmission, but countries differ in their feasibility and need to do so.

In countries where this hasn’t happened, health centres have been reconfigured to make it possible to isolate potential cases into separate ‘zones’ or ‘circuits’, and prevent staff from working across different pathways to reduce exposure.

This is happening in Spain, where elective surgery is only being resumed in hospitals where Covid patients make up 5% of total capacity. There providers are also doing things like restructuring appointments, so that all pre-surgery assessments happen remotely or on the same day to avoid multiple visits.

A smaller number of countries have also found capacity by redistributing resources regionally to areas less overwhelmed by Covid-19. This has happened in France, Spain and Italy, where staff or patients were moved to redistribute capacity more evenly throughout their respective health systems. Doing so has been less practical in countries like the UK, where the virus has spread more widely across regions and localities.

Another key difference has been around staff pay. Covid-19 prompted a handful of countries (such as Germany, France and Canada) to increase wages or provide bonus payments to key health and care workers, particularly those in lower paid roles or those working in high-risk environments.

In many cases those uplifts were temporary, and only applied to the peak Covid months.

What are some of the main considerations for countries as they reopen services?  
Health systems are all in very different stages of resuming services, but there are some common decisions that many countries have to face. They include how best to manage infection control, which services to prioritise, and how much reserve capacity to maintain in the event of future outbreaks.

Countries have varied in their approach, and again the choices they make will in part be influenced by their existing resources going into the pandemic.

Reconfiguring health care facilities to reduce transmission and build in greater slack will place constraints on what health systems can deliver. The NHS entered the crisis with real pressures that are unlikely to go away any time soon, even with the recent £3 billion funding announcement.

The key thing is getting patients back through the system as quickly and as safely as they can, but as long as the NHS has to remain Covid-19 resilient then access will be reduced and people will unfortunately be left waiting longer.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Covid-19: how is it impacting on prisoners’ health?","Dr Miranda Davies","In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were serious concerns that without intervention it would spread rapidly in prisons. Modelling estimations by Public Health England made available in late April suggested that, without action, there could be as many as 77,800 cases and 2,700 deaths from a prison population of around 81,000. The prison estate consequently implemented its own version of lockdown – which most notably meant the majority of prisoners remaining locked in their cells for at least 23 hours a day.

The prison estate has not yet seen the numbers of cases that were initially feared. Up to June 15th, there have been 502 confirmed positive cases of prisoners with Covid-19, with 971 staff also testing positive. 23 prisoners and 9 staff are reported to have died as a result of the virus.

As in the wider population, the actual numbers of cases are likely to be much higher than those identified through formal testing. PHE estimated 1,385 ‘possible/probable cases’ based on confirmed numbers within prisons, but the numbers are still significantly less than the worst-case scenario.

With a framework now in place outlining the plans to ease lockdown restrictions in prisons, we consider here the future for people in prison while Covid-19 remains a threat, as well as the impact on access to health care. 

Ongoing management of Covid-19 in prisons
Life for people in prison is currently severely restricted. As well as having to spend more hours in their cells, Covid-19 has meant that education and most employment have been all but halted, and there are no face-to-face family visits taking place.

Measures have also been introduced to reduce the flow and spread of new cases into prisons. That is challenging from the outset, however, as there isn’t space to put everyone in single cell accommodation. At some prisons, temporary cells have been added outside in an attempt to alleviate the pressure on existing cell space. 

Many of the current restrictions will remain to a greater or lesser extent while Covid-19 is in general circulation, and will exacerbate the challenges in prisons caused by outdated facilities and overcrowded conditions.

Scrutiny visits by HM Inspectorate of Prisons during the pandemic have highlighted the difficulties of following public health guidance in prisons – and where conditions are not what we might expect in 2020. A visit to three category C training prisons, for instance, noted that at one prison – Coldingley – people were having to use buckets in their cells as toilets at night, as the cells did not have built-in sanitation. They otherwise had to wait to be let out to go to communal toilets, which could take up to two hours.

Management of the virus also needs to be considered alongside the mental and physical health impact on prisoners. Prior to Covid-19, self-harm rates in prison were high, and increasing. There were over 63,000 incidents of self-harm in 2019, which was a rise of 14% on the previous year. Self-harm rates have been a point of concern in HMIP scrutiny visits – with higher levels now than before the pandemic.

The impact on prisoners of having very little time outside their cells, and little or no meaningful contact with others, cannot be understated. As a possible sign of the pressure that restrictions have had, in May there were five suicides in prisons over a six-day period.

The impact of Covid-19 on prisoners’ access to health care
Even under ‘normal’ circumstances, prisoners face poorer access to hospital services than the general population do. In 2017/18, prisoners had 24% fewer inpatient admissions and outpatient attendances than the equivalent age and sex demographic in the wider population, and 45% fewer attendances at A&E departments.

While Covid-19 remains a threat, access is likely to be further restricted. That raises concerns about both unmet need and a further widening of the gap between how often and why prisoners and those in the general population access services.   

Access to hospital services for prisoners is dependent on initial triage in prison. With most prisoners only out of their cells for short periods each day, being physically seen by health care staff in prison is likely to be more difficult.

Demand for limited access to secondary health care will also increase, as people may need to go to hospital due to symptoms of Covid-19. However, prisons will still need to manage the care needs of patients who require unavoidable hospital care, such as dialysis. That means the threshold (how sick people need to be) to go to hospital will invariably increase.

Crucially, staff also need to be available to escort prisoners to hospital. Some staff will have Covid-19 themselves or be self-isolating, and this may affect escort capacity.

Maintaining social distancing in prison means everyday tasks take longer, as people can only be let out of their cells in small groups. Staff are more stretched to maintain even a basic regime where people can shower or make a phone call. That cumulatively means fewer staff being available and more to physically do for the staff who are there. 

Easing lockdown in prisons
The framework criteria that have to be met in order to ease restrictions in prisons make it clear that change is likely to be slow and that there will be local-level variation.

This inherent flexibility, alongside very little publicly available information about what is happening in prisons, means it would be very easy for the status quo to be maintained.

In reality, conditions in some prisons were poor before the coronavirus and there is therefore a real risk that managing Covid-19 becomes an excuse to do nothing.

Over the coming months it is crucial that, alongside stopping the spread of the virus in the prison population, there is a concerted effort to understand and publicly report on the impact of regime changes on the lives of people living and working in prison. Prisoners and their families, as well as those working in prisons, should not be forgotten.",0,"Covid",""),
(0,"Reducing avoidable harms to children during Covid-19: what actions are needed?","Dr Charlotte Paddison","This week doctors have been alerted to watch out for a rare but very serious new illness among children. The numbers affected appear to be very small, and research is underway to determine whether or not it is linked to Covid-19. Most children catching the coronavirus thankfully recover in full without any serious health effects.

Yet with concern that children are among those who could become ‘collateral damage’ from the crisis, what actions could be taken now to make a difference to protect the youngest members in society from avoidable harms?

Better identification
One of the first things that is needed is an enhanced process for identifying very vulnerable children that require the highest measures of social protection – known as ‘shielding’. Thousands of people appear to have been missed off the government’s ‘high risk’ list for the virus, which could mean children too.

Personal communication from one community paediatric team found that only a small proportion – approximately 1 in 4 children – identified as needing shielding via clinical review had received a letter formally recommending such measures. Doctors there had reviewed a list of seriously ill children under their care to identify those where shielding was clinically indicated based on the child’s health conditions, and found many children who appeared to have been missed.

So what might help? The current approach could be usefully supported by a rapid review by paediatricians of children under their care or, where that is not practical, automated searches of GP records for children with multiple or complex health conditions. 

Keeping vulnerable children safe
Protecting the most vulnerable children – including looked-after children, disabled children and young carers – must continue to be seen as a policy priority. With calls to the National Domestic Abuse hotline up by a worrying 25% since the lockdown started, children on ‘at risk’ registers are an important group to focus upon.

That means protecting the staffing of children’s services – including mental health and social services – so that those essential to protecting children’s health continue to be available. CAMHS referrals in some areas are being declined because of the virus, and where professional support is available to young carers or children with mental health problems, for now it is mainly limited to phone calls. 

With families and children’s services creaking under increasing strain, one solution might be an "army of volunteers for vulnerable kids", as suggested by the Children’s Commissioner. They might be people who are able to help social services and schools reach children and families, check in on what is going on, while offering support to those families.

Avoiding delays in diagnosis
It is vital that parents with a seriously ill child know how they can get help. Seeing a doctor at a GP practice is generally the first port of call for parents with an ill child, but this route of access has changed beyond all recognition. NHS England has instructed practitioners to do remote consultations “as a default”, with GPs reportedly seeing only seven in every 100 patients in person. 

It is hard to downplay the clinical value of physically seeing a really sick child, and we must find a way to provide fast access to ‘face-to-face’ medicine where it is still needed. Key here is to communicate that practices are still open, with GPs keen to stress they are safe to visit. With clinical commissioning groups increasingly concerned that people are not coming to seek care from GP practices when it is urgently needed, more effort may be needed to ensure this message is clear.

Parents also need to know that, in most cases, the benefits for a seriously sick child of going to A&E are likely to outweigh the risks of exposure to Covid-19.    

An intelligent plan
While services for life-threatening conditions such as childhood leukaemia are rightly being prioritised, a growing volume of ‘sub-acute’ work for children with serious long-term conditions is being put on ice. 

This includes delays in blood tests needed to monitor disease flares and medication-related harms among children with autoimmune conditions, cuts to physiotherapy for children with physical disabilities, and delays in the treatment of bacterial lung infections among children with cystic fibrosis. Many services for chronically ill children have been drastically reduced or temporarily cut altogether, which may go on for some months. 

Clinical teams will now need to develop an intelligent plan for catching up on the work that has fallen on the back burner. 

With many hospitals now unexpectedly quiet after mothballing normal operations in preparation for the coronavirus, there is an urgent need to develop streams of work that benefit patients but which are not associated with increased clinical risk due to Covid-19 infection. And which can be flexibly stepped up during quiet spells and switched off if Covid-19 patient numbers increase.

That could include clinical audits, review and triage of incoming referrals, taking histories from new patients via phone or video and identifying those needing immediate priority action – desk-based tasks that mean when clinical work properly resumes it can do so as quickly and efficiently as possible.

A coordinated effort is also needed across specialities working with children to set priorities for post-Covid recovery, and make sure that in the rush to catch up, the focus is on resuming services and interventions that make the biggest difference to improving and protecting children’s health.

Acting now to protect children from avoidable harms
There have been rapid service innovations (particularly in primary care) that, together with delays and reduced access to children’s services, not only bring a range of future opportunities for more focused and nimble working but also risks, unintended consequences and potential harms.  

Some of these harms will be avoidable, and can be mitigated by actions taken now to identify vulnerable children, keep essential services in place, avoid delays in diagnosis, and make an intelligent plan for catching up in the months ahead.",0,"Covid","");

(0,"Safety in health and social care","Jessica Morris","The NHS is aspiring to be “one of the safest healthcare systems in the world”. But healthcare is a high-risk activity, and improving safety requires us to address the environment in which care is delivered, and to look beyond individual incidents or mistakes. An open and transparent safety culture is needed, where staff are encouraged to report risks and incidents, and action is taken to learn from them and ensure they do not reoccur.

Measuring how the safety of healthcare is changing over time is challenging and complex. There is more information available about harm to patients than there is about whether or not services are safe. Further to this, adverse events and near-misses tend to be under-reported, so an increased reporting of such events may reflect an improved awareness of safety issues rather than a less safe environment. And safety in healthcare is a moving target – as standards improve we come to regard an increasing number of events as patient safety issues, for example, the increased focus on healthcare-associated infections in recent years.

Here at QualityWatch, we’ve reviewed and updated our indicators looking at how the safety of NHS care has changed over time. Although there are some gaps in the data, due to limited information in areas such as primary care and community settings, we have been able to identify indicators at a national level across many aspects of safety. While some measures show an improvement, such as the management of venous thromboembolism and hospital cleanliness, other measures, such as the proportion of hip fracture cases that have prompt surgery, have not improved. Please find below a summary of our safety indicators, and click on the links for more content and analysis.

Safety culture
View the indicator

A good safety culture in healthcare is one where staff have positive perceptions of psychological safety, teamwork and leadership, and feel comfortable discussing errors.
The proportion of NHS Staff Survey respondents who “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that when errors, near misses or incidents are reported their organisation takes action to ensure that they do not happen again increased slightly from 67% in 2015 to 69% in 2017.
NHS staff working in Acute Specialist Trusts report that their organisation takes the most action to ensure that incidents do not happen again, and Ambulance Trust staff report that their organisation takes the least action.
In 2017, seven out of ten NHS Staff Survey respondents “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that they would feel secure raising concerns about unsafe clinical practice, up from 68% in 2014.
General managers, nurses and midwives, and medical/dental consultants feel more secure raising concerns than medical/dental trainees and ambulance staff.
Are patients told about medication side effects?
View the indicator

Effective communication to patients of medication and side effects to watch for is an important aspect of patient safety.
Less than half of survey respondents said that they were “completely” told about medication side effects to watch for. Over a third of survey respondents were not told about side effects to watch for.
Between 2009 and 2017, the proportion of Adult Inpatient Survey respondents who were “completely” or “to some extent” told about medication side effects to watch for increased from 54% to 57%.
Hospital cleanliness
View the indicator

Across the NHS, cleanliness is a vital part of ensuring safe, high-quality care. Failure to meet the required standards could lead to the spread of infections, ward closures and potentially impact the health of patients and staff.
The proportion of Adult Inpatient Survey respondents who said that their room or ward was “very clean” increased from 63% in 2009 to 70% in 2017.
Healthcare-associated infections
View the indicator

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are bacterial infections which commonly occur as a direct result of healthcare interventions, or from being in contact with a healthcare setting.
In 2007, the levels of C. difficile and MRSA became a major national concern, and action to address these problems was far reaching. Between 2007 and 2014, there was a 76% reduction in C. difficile cases and an 81% reduction in MRSA cases. Since then, the annual counts of these bacterial infections has fluctuated.
Enhanced surveillance of E. coli has been mandatory for NHS acute trusts since 2011. Between 2012 and 2017, the total number of E. coli infections increased by 27%, prompting the launch of a government initiative to reduce Gram-negative bloodstream infections. However, some of the increase may reflect higher rates of blood culture testing as awareness of sepsis has increased.
Injuries due to falls
View the indicator

Patients in hospital should receive the help and support they need to prevent falls and injuries such as hip fractures. And all patients with a hip fracture should be operated on promptly, to improve the outcome.
In England, the percentage of hip fractures that happened in hospital (rather than in homes, care homes and outside) decreased from 4.9% in March 2012 to 3.7% in September 2018. The proportion is higher in Wales but lower in Northern Ireland.
The percentage of hip fractures cases having prompt surgery (within 36 hours) is higher in winter than summer, and has been declining over time in England since 2014. On average, 75% of hip fracture patients in England have surgery within 36 hours, compared with 63% of patients in Wales and only 25% of patients in Northern Ireland.
Venous thromboembolism
View the indicator

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious medical condition which can affect patients after surgery or other medical care.
Since 2010/11, there has been an increase in the proportion of adult inpatients whose risk of VTE was assessed. The 95% target was introduced in 2013/14 as part of the national VTE CQUIN goal, and the 95% threshold has been exceeded since 2013/14 Q1.
Between 2007 and 2016, the rate of patients who were admitted to hospital with any cause and died within 90 days of their last discharge from a VTE related event decreased from 72 to 62 deaths per 100,000 adult hospital admissions.
Emergency readmissions
View the indicator

Between 2010/11 and 2016/17, the number of 30-day emergency readmissions to hospital in England increased by 19%, and the emergency readmissions rate increased from 7.5% to 8%.
Patients who are readmitted to hospital with pressure sores or VTE, when these conditions were not diagnosed in their previous admission, may have received suboptimal care. The emergency readmissions rate for pressure sores increased from 0.05% of admissions in 2010/11 to 0.13% of admissions in 2016/17. The emergency readmissions rate for VTE increased from 0.11% to 0.13% over the same time period.
Suicide in mental health service users
View the indicator

Suicides by people in contact with mental health services are arguably the most preventable. In the UK, there were 1,612 suicides by people who had been in contact with mental health services in the previous 12 months in 2016. This accounts for 27% of all suicides in the general population.
Between 2006 and 2016, the number of suicides by people in contact with mental health services in the UK increased by 11%. However, this is overshadowed by a substantial decrease in the rate of patient suicide, when you take account of the rising number of people receiving mental health care.
Social care users and safety
View the indicator

The Personal Social Services Adult Social Care Survey (ASCS) asks service users if care and support services help them in feeling safe. Between 2014-15 and 2017-18, the proportion of services users who responded “Yes” they do help them in feeling safe increased slightly from 85% to 86%.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Our response to new guidance on alcohol consumption","Anonymous","Researchers at the Nuffield Trust health think tank published a report on 22nd December which showed the extent of the challenge to the NHS posed by harmful drinking. Commenting on the new guidance on alcohol consumption from the Chief Medical Officer today, report author Dr Alisha Davies said:

“The CMO’s evidence based guidelines for alcohol consumption are welcome, given the rising demands alcohol related harm is placing on health services and wider society. Our research before Christmas found worrying trends in attendances and admissions to hospital specific to alcohol. The rate at which people are entering NHS wards for reasons specific to alcohol has gone up by over 50% in the past nine years.

The number of admissions now tops a quarter of a million a year. We also found those with alcohol related liver disease tended to be associated with higher hospital use for up to five years before diagnosis, underlining how this condition can come from a person’s health deteriorating in a way that could be preventable. These statistics, however, are at the extreme end of harmful drinking, and only represent the tip of the iceberg. 

“The CMO’s clear message is that drinking any alcohol can have harmful effects on health. It’s not always an easy message, but people who drink really do need to watch their intake carefully”.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"UK young people let down on long-term illness, new international report finds","Anonymous","Young people in the UK are making healthier life choices for themselves than before, but are more likely to die from asthma or have a poor quality of life from long-term conditions compared to counterparts in other high-income countries.

This is according to the first ever international comparison of young people’s health measures over time, comparing the UK to 18 other high-income countries, published today by the Nuffield Trust and the Association for Young People’s Health [AYPH].

The report, written by paediatricians and researchers at the Nuffield Trust and AYPH, is based on analysis of 17 measures of the health and wellbeing of young people, aged 10-24, between the mid-1990s and the last year for which data are comparable. The indicators examined by the authors include long-standing illnesses; alcohol consumption; cancer mortality; obesity and deprivation.

The UK sits in the bottom third of the comparative countries in nine out of 17 indicators, and in the top third in three. In four out of 17 indicators, trends over time have been getting worse, and in five areas previous improvements have stalled.  

Key findings from the report conclude that:

The UK has the highest rate of deaths from asthma for young people aged 10-24, compared to all European countries in the comparator group, and the fourth highest overall behind the USA, Australia and New Zealand. The asthma mortality rate in the UK was approximately twice as high as that of the next worst country in Europe, and any improvements made have started to stall in the last few years.
Nearly one in five young people in the UK are estimated to be living with a long-standing health condition, and the UK is one of the worst countries for young people to suffer from years lost to ill health and the burden of their diseases like diabetes.
As well as having the highest rates of obesity in 15 to 19-year-olds compared to the 14 European countries, the UK also has one of the greatest differences in obesity levels between young people living in the poorest areas of the country and the richest.
The UK is in the middle of the pack compared to other countries on some indicators for young people, including cancer mortality, smoking, alcohol consumption and cannabis use. Trends in health-related behaviours like smoking and alcohol consumption have been improving in recent years, with falls in smoking rates and use of cannabis.
The UK has some of the lowest rates of road traffic injury deaths, which have also been steadily improving over time. Authors put this down to a concerted effort from industry and government to make both cars and roads safer.
On the whole, the UK performs in the top third of countries on mortality rates for 10 to 19-year-olds. Recently, however, progress has stalled and for young people aged 20-24 got worse between 2013 and 2016.
The report calls into question whether health services are adequately helping young people to manage their long-term conditions. For example, a National Paediatric Diabetes Audit for 2016–17 reported that only 43.6% of those aged over 12 received all seven key health care checks during the previous year of care.

These findings are made in the context of 20 to 24-year-olds in the UK having the third highest levels of material deprivation in Europe (behind Greece and Italy), which the authors argue is having a knock-on effect on all other indicators. The report warns that the government and senior health leaders should look at these findings with real foreboding: inequalities must be closed and cuts to public health budgets addressed if they are serious about reversing these worrying trends.

Nigel Edwards, Chief Executive of the Nuffield Trust said:

“Making sure we have a healthy population requires us all to do our bit. More than ever, young people are holding up their side of the bargain, with more of them choosing to smoke and drink less, yet our health system seems to be getting something badly wrong. I worry this reflects a dangerous complacency. 

“Young people in the UK are entering adulthood with more long-term health conditions and as a result a poorer quality of life, storing up problems further down the line. If we don’t take action now, the next generation will be entering adulthood sicker than the one before it.”

Emma Rigby, Chief Executive at the Association for Young People’s Health said:

“The crucial thing to note here is how important long-term health conditions are in the 10-24 age group. We need more understanding of young people’s health needs, improved support for young people to understand and manage their own health, and we need to provide more youth friendly health services. This will help improve our standing internationally in terms of youth health outcomes.”

Baroness Doreen Massey of Darwen, Patron of the Association for Young People’s Health and Chair of All Party Parliamentary Group for Young People’s Health said:

“This comprehensive report is a wake-up call to improve health services for our young people and is a timely inspiration in the wake of the new NHS Long Term Plan. Investment in young people aged 10 to 24 is urgently needed in order to have healthy adults in the future.

“It is encouraging to see that young people are taking the initiative to have healthier lives in some areas, but policy initiatives and youth friendly services are needed, coupled with more action to tackle determinants of health including deprivation, inequality and young people not in education, employment and training.”",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Cancer","Jenny Davies","Cancer services were under increasing pressure even before the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The headline target that 85% of patients should start a first treatment for cancer within two months of an urgent GP referral has not been met since 2015, and while cancer survival rates in the UK are improving, they still lag behind in international comparisons.

Despite efforts to maintain cancer treatment during the pandemic, there has been a significant impact on services. Referrals and first consultant appointments for suspected cancer fell, while emergency presentations increased. Cancellations to treatment for cancer were also reported. New guidance published in March 2021 outlines plans to fully restore cancer services, including meeting the increased level of referrals and treatment required to address the fall in first treatments for cancer by March 2022. Activity is recovering to near normal levels, but a considerable backlog of patients waiting for diagnosis or treatment remains.

With almost four in 10 cases of cancer linked to known risk factors, we’ve looked at trends in smoking, alcohol use, and obesity. We’ve also updated our indicators looking at the quality of care along the cancer pathway, including screening, diagnosis and treatment, as well as survival and mortality rates.

Smoking
See the indicator>>

The percentage of people using NHS Stop Smoking Services who self-reported that they were successful in quitting at four weeks remained relatively steady between 2007/08 and 2019/20, at around 50%. In Q1 and Q2 2020/21 (April to September 2020), following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it increased to 58%.
The number of people using NHS Stop Smoking Services who set a quit date has fallen for eight consecutive years, from 816,444 in 2011/12 to 221,678 in 2019/20.
Alcohol-related harm and drinking behaviour
See the indicator>>

In England, the alcohol-related deaths rate has remained roughly constant over time, fluctuating between a high of 48 deaths per 100,000 population in 2008 and a low of 46 deaths per 100,000 population in 2014.
According to the Health Survey for England, between 2006 and 2019 heavy drinking fell for people aged 16 to 54 years old, but increased for people aged 65 and over.
Between 2006 and 2019, there has been a large decrease in the percentage of 8 to 15-year-olds who reported that they have had an alcoholic drink. The largest decrease was in 13 to 15-year-olds, where the percentage who had drunk alcohol fell from 67% to 35%.
Obesity
See the indicator>>

The proportion of adults who are obese has increased from 15% in 1993 to 28% in 2019.
Between 2006/07 and 2019/20, the proportion of children aged 10-11 who were obese increased from 17% to 21%.
HPV vaccination coverage
See the indicator>>

In the 2019/20 school year, coverage of two doses of the HPV vaccine (which helps protect against cervical cancer) fell to 65%, following school immunisation programmes being paused when schools closed during the first national lockdown. This compares to coverage of 84% for two doses in the 2018/19 school year.
Cancer screening
See the indicator>>

Breast screening coverage in England increased from 64% in 2001/02 to 77% in 2009/10, then remained stable until 2012/13, when it began to decrease. In 2019/20, breast screening coverage was 72%.
Cervical screening coverage for the total target age group (25 to 64 years) fell from 76% in 2010/11 to 72% in 2019/20.
Bowel screening coverage in England increased from 35% in 2009/10 to 64% in 2019/20.
GP referrals
See the indicator>>

Between the weeks starting 16 March and 13 April 2020, the number of two-week wait referrals for suspected cancer fell by 67%. Over the summer and autumn of 2020, referrals increased to similar numbers as before the Covid-19 pandemic. By the week starting 19 April 2021, there were 60,095 referrals for suspected cancer.
Diagnostic test waiting times
See the indicator>>

The proportion of patients waiting six weeks or more for a diagnostic test increased from 0.7% in February 2010 to 2.8% in February 2020. In March 2020, it began to increase dramatically, reaching 58% in May 2020. Since then, performance has improved but remains worse than before the pandemic. In March 2021, 24% of patients had been waiting six weeks or more for a diagnostic test.
Since 2008, the waiting list for a diagnostic test has been steadily increasing. However, in March 2020, the waiting list fell to 838,569 (22% lower than in March 2019). It has since increased to over 1.2 million in March 2021.
The number of diagnostic tests carried out has been increasing over time, but fell sharply from 1.9 million in February 2020 to 612,232 in April 2020. The number of tests carried out increased to over 1.9 million in March 2021.
Cancer waiting times
See the indicator>>

Between 2009 and 2014, the percentage of people with suspected cancer having their first consultant appointment within two weeks of an urgent GP referral fluctuated around 95%. Since then, performance has declined. In Q4 2020/21, 89% of patients had their first consultant appointment within two weeks.
The proportion of patients waiting less than 31 days for a first treatment for cancer following a decision to treat decreased from 98% in Q3 2009/10 to 96% in Q3 2020/21. The 96% threshold has not been met since Q3 2019/20.
The proportion of patients waiting less than two months to start cancer treatment following an urgent GP referral for suspected cancer has decreased considerably over time, from 87% in Q4 2008/09 to 72% in Q4 2020/21.
Patients’ overall experience of cancer services

Breast cancer mortality has been declining in the UK, falling from 38 deaths per 100,000 women in 2001 to 28 deaths per 100,000 women in 2016. However, the UK consistently has a relatively high breast cancer mortality rate compared to other countries.
In 2001, the UK had one of the highest cervical cancer mortality rates of all the comparator countries, but by 2016 the UK’s ranking had improved to about average.
Colorectal cancer mortality has been slowly decreasing over time in the UK, falling from 26 deaths per 100,000 population in 2001 to 22 deaths per 100,000 population in 2016. The UK’s performance is about average for the comparator countries.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Prisoner health and homeless health: understanding the links between them","Dr Miranda Davies & David Parker-Radford","Delivering health care in prisons presents unique challenges. Nuffield Trust’s research project, funded by the Health Foundation, is using hospital data to gain a better picture of the health needs of prisoners and the use they make of secondary health care services. We have also been thinking about the impact of wider social and contextual factors on the health of the prisoner population. This blog examines one common and striking characteristic – the number of prisoners with experience of homelessness before and after their imprisonment. 

Homelessness is hard to measure, but in 2017 it was estimated that over 250,000 people in England were homeless – around 1 in 200 people. At least 15% of people are homeless on arrival in prison, and an even larger proportion are likely to be homeless on release. Between January and March last year, more than 7,000 people left prison to either 'unsettled’ or unknown accommodation, which often translates into sleeping rough or temporary accommodation. When people describe prison as a revolving door, homelessness can be a contributory factor. 

But what are the health issues that link prisoners and those who are homeless, and are there common approaches that might help both groups?

Health care issues in common
We know that historical experience of abuse, being taken into care and unemployment can affect prisoners’ health , and the same can be true for people who become homeless. Indeed, while less than 1% of children are in care, a quarter of the prison population and a similar proportion of people who are homeless have been in the care system. This can affect people’s attachments, relationships and mental wellbeing.

Head injuries are also more prevalent for people who have these experiences than they are for other parts of society. Some 4% of all hospital admissions by prisoners relate to injuries to the head, and research in Glasgow found that being homeless means you are five times more likely than the rest of the population to be admitted to hospital with a traumatic brain injury.

Such injuries are often the result of assaults. Since 2010, physical attacks against prisoners have doubled.

Reducing staffing and funding in prisons contribute to an environment where prisons become less safe with an increased risk of being an assault victim. Self-harm incidents in prison are also at record highs according to the Prison Reform Trust. Crisis argues that people who are homeless are 17 times more likely to be a victim of violence, with one in three reporting they had been hit or kicked over the previous year.

Beyond head injuries, health needs related to the use of drugs and alcohol are also a significant issue. Crisis reports that two-thirds of people interviewed said that drug or alcohol use was a reason for them becoming homeless, while in 2017/18 more than 55,000 over 18s in secure settings such as prisons were receiving alcohol or drug treatment.

How can things be improved?
At a time where rough sleeping has increased by 165% since 2010, it’s more vital than ever to ensure that leaving prison does not lead to people becoming homeless, and that becoming homeless doesn’t lead towards imprisonment. We need more options for safe and secure accommodation for all people at risk of homelessness, including those leaving prison.

The government has launched a pilot project to support prisoners to find accommodation on release, but housing is only part of the picture – the way that health care is managed in prisons and on release also has a role to play. Prison provides regular food and somewhere to sleep, and for those with a health condition such as diabetes, being in that environment and having access to health care may mean it is well controlled. Leaving a routine without the right support in place, particularly if homeless, can contribute to people ending up in A&E or back in the criminal justice system.

Pilot projects that address specific health needs (such as the Drug Recovery Prison pilot) are helpful, but we need to know what ‘works’ or shows promise before applying it more broadly. What can be effective is for health professionals such as nurses providing support in prison that can continue to impact on health when people leave prisons.

For instance, last year the Queen’s Nursing Institute funded a project to offer latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing to prisoners at HMP Birmingham, aiming to improve people’s self-care on release. 10% of people tested positive for LTBI and were given vital treatment. The project offers an encouraging case for more people in prisons to have awareness about TB, as well as more testing in prisons to evaluate whether there is a public health case for a nationally applied prison screening programme. Having a community nurse able to come into prison to deliver care also helped to identify other issues and helped to join up care between prison health and the community health teams.

Breaking the cycle
Ultimately the health of people in prison is about more than what happens in prison. It reflects their wider experience such as homelessness, and it is important that these overlaps are acknowledged and underlying health problems addressed, to give prisoners the best possible chance of sustaining good health when they are released.

If some people arrive at prison having previously been homeless, and some leave prison with nowhere to go, it can be impossible to escape that cycle.

(0,"Can the Long Term Plan really save half a million lives?","Billy Palmer","Forecasting the future is inherently difficult. And given the NHS’s size and the multitude of factors affecting both service performance and patient outcomes, making predictions about the health service is particularly challenging. With the privilege of hindsight, we can reflect on some instances where goals were just too optimistic to be met, like the commitments to trusts returning to financial balance in year. At other times, apparently very high targets have actually been achieved – such as the push to limit waiting times to 18 weeks. So what would it take to achieve the headline ambition of the NHS Long Term Plan?

A bold ambition
NHS England’s press release led with the prediction that the Plan would “save up to half a million lives”, a number picked up by the media. The statement goes on to say the “latest technology… coupled with early detection and a renewed focus on prevention [will] stop an estimated 85,000 premature deaths each year” including saving 55,000 more cancer patients’ lives annually.

A death is deemed as:
■ amenable (treatable) if all or most deaths from that cause could be avoided through good quality healthcare (e.g. those caused by complications during birth)
■ preventable if, all or most deaths from that could be avoided by public health interventions in the broadest sense (e.g. from alcohol related diseases)
■ avoidable if preventable, amenable (treatable) or both. Because many deaths are both, this is less than the sum of the two categories.
On first inspection, these figures look demanding. Based on recent and historic Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures, around a quarter of deaths in England – in the region of 110,000 a year – are avoidable, either through better healthcare or healthier public behaviours (see box). Of these only around 60,000 could be avoided through healthcare.

But single comparisons rarely give the entire picture and performance will be influenced not only by the scale of the action taken but also by the definitions used to measure it. So what do we need to assume and what needs to happen if these laudable ambitions are to be met? 

Consistent counting
How performance is measured will be a key factor, with the definition used to classify a ‘life saved’ having a large bearing on the number achieved. NHS England shared some details with us about how they added together figures from expert groups to reach their figure – and we can see there are indeed different definitions of avoided deaths at work. 

NHS England focus on those that are alive, counting the number of times a life is saved, whereas ONS focus on those that have died and instead count how many of these deaths could have been avoided. A person could be saved from both suicide and cancer, and count twice in NHS England’s sums but only reduce the national statistics by one.

NHS England also count people who survive for five years after diagnosis of cancer as being lives saved. But not all these people, sadly, will live much longer. Performance against this measure could improve purely through earlier diagnosis without actually prolonging lives although, of course, earlier diagnosis can contribute to better outcomes. The impact on the rate of deaths, which is what national statistics will show, would be less than the impact on five year survival. 

Increased scope
A growing and aging population might also help to make the target more manageable by increasing the number of lives to potentially save. While England’s population is only expected to grow by around 5% to 2028, the number of people aged over 75 is predicted to increase by around 30%. It is unclear quite how this will affect the number of potentially avoidable deaths but with increased prevalence of disease in this older population, there may be greater scope for life-saving interventions. However, progress here would require turning around a situation where life expectancy for these groups has recently been stalling.

Taking a closer look at the largest component within the overall figure – saving 55,000 more cancer patients’ lives annually – gives an indication of the potential effect of an aging and growing population. ONS estimated around 140,000 deaths from cancer in England in 2017. However, based on numbers from a 2016 study there could be an estimated 160,000 deaths from cancer in 2028.

This also demonstrates the importance of the definition of ‘lives saved’. If NHS England used the ONS definition of avoidable deaths, about a third of deaths would need to be avoided to meet the 55,000 lives saved. But the ONS deemed only around 36% of cancer deaths in 2016 were avoidable (see chart), so the goal would be equivalent to the total estimated number of avoidable cancer deaths. Including increasing five year survival rates in the definition obviously changes the picture.Action on over 75s
NHS England might also be identifying some causes of death as avoidable when the ONS would not. For most causes of deaths, the ONS exclude people 75 and over from their count of avoidable mortality. The majority of this cohort have three or more conditions on their death certificate making it difficult to estimate ‘avoidability’ of deaths. But, while not including them in their estimates, the ONS do recognise some conditions in the avoidable mortality definition may be effectively treated at older ages and so it would be right for NHS England to seek to include them in its calculation. This is a material consideration – around three-quarters of all deaths are for people aged 75 and over. The difficulty is that we don’t have a national statistical benchmark for knowing how avoidable their deaths are.

Best in class
International data on avoidable deaths, using OECD criteria similar to those of the ONS, suggests the NHS would have to become a world-beater to save half a million lives. The available data show we already have fewer avoidable deaths than average for EU countries, and matching the performance of the very best for preventable (Italy) and amenable (France) mortality would represent 28% and 33% falls, respectively – well short of what is required. On cancer, matching the best performance from a European country (Finland) within the data on deaths from cancer would represent a 21% fall.

Within England, reducing the nation’s average to that of the best performing region (East of England) in 2013 would only have resulted in around a 12,000 fall (11%) in deaths deemed avoidable in the ONS’s estimates. This suggests every area would likely have to increase its performance considerably – just matching the current best is unlikely to be sufficient.

Prioritise prevention
What the data can tell us is the importance of wider initiatives to improve health if something like this target is to be achievable. Nearly half of avoidable deaths are not considered amenable to healthcare but instead require broader prevention. Indeed, last year the WHO made a plea for more ambition tackling non-communicable diseases, such as strokes and most heart diseases, for which a person’s background, lifestyle and environment are risk factors. Their report challenges European countries to work on broader prevention in order to reduce premature mortality from such diseases by at least 45% by 2030. Against this ambition, the Plan’s goal looks rather conservative.

In this light the commitments in the Plan to use funding to support, for example, smoking cessation, obesity reduction and even cleaner air programmes are promising. Yet the NHS itself has relatively few levers over public health. The main budgets for it held by councils are being sharply cut, and services like police and education are under serious pressure. And these factors tend to determine health outcomes over a timescale of decades – longer even than a long term plan looks ahead.

Open book
The detailed “bottom up” approach NHS England explained to us, with efforts to prevent double-counting between the effect of different initiatives, is reassuring. And as we have seen, different definitions will lead to quite different numbers.

That said, we think it essential that NHS England are fully transparent and publish the calculation and its methodology. Health service managers and researchers need to understand their implications and what is required. Transparent publication would also help in judging performance later so there was no confusion or misunderstanding about the difference between ‘avoidable deaths’ (the international currency) and the goal of ‘lives saved’ that NHS England has set out.

But, whatever the definition, as my colleague John Appleby previously highlighted, avoidable deaths are worth being concerned about. So I’ll be keeping tabs on performance with a keen eye. And fingers crossed.",0,"Medicle",""),
(0,"Win win: how smoke-free policies can benefit both the NHS and its patients","Euan Holmes","In July the Government published its new Tobacco Control Plan: Towards a smoke-free generation. It envisages a future in which the prevalence of smoking could be reduced to 5 per cent or less – a smoke-free generation.

A key theme is an increased emphasis on the role of the NHS in tackling tobacco use. In terms of specific policy, the Plan includes a government commitment to “support the implementation of smoke-free policies across all hospitals in England”, aiming for a smoke-free NHS estate by 2020.

Renewed commitment to this policy puts it under the spotlight, but it is crucial that its merits be evaluated not on its own, but as part of a broader framework seeking to achieve the Plan’s ambitious targets.

What is the harm?
Accounting for 27 per cent of lung cancer deaths, 35 per cent of respiratory deaths, and 13 per cent of all circulatory disease deaths, the impact of smoking on the health service is readily discernible. In addition, smokers are 38 per cent more likely to die from surgery than non-smokers.

A smoker’s visit to an NHS site often serves to underscore the harmful effects of tobacco use, but it is exactly this that can make NHS sites conducive to smoking cessation. The increased tangibility of risk can encourage quit attempts. Plus advice from clinicians is, as the Plan argues, “one of the most effective ways of triggering a quit attempt”.

In promoting this mindset, the Plan picks up a thread already present in NICE guidance, Very Brief Advice training, and Making Every Contact Count. The smoke-free estates policy can serve to unify these strands, providing the necessary backdrop, as well as give renewed impetus to encourage more smokers to quit.

Prohibiting smoking on NHS estates is not a means to punish those who smoke, but instead underlines that they are places where the harms caused by tobacco are recognised and challenged, and where efforts to quit are fully supported.

How should it be done?
For smoke-free policies to be fully effective, the referral processes and cessation support they seek to bolster must be firmly in place. For those who aim to quit, cessation must be seen as a treatment; referrals to smoking cessation services must be embedded in care pathways.

Effective implementation requires strong leadership and staff buy-in. Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of Public Health England, has written of how Medway NHS Foundation Trust, before the introduction of their smoke-free estates policy, offered staff free Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Helping staff to quit is an important part of the process identified by NICE, and it can help to bring staff on board – encouraging the ‘smoke-free champions’ that Selbie describes.

A comprehensive approach in line with NICE guidance is particularly crucial in mental health trusts. To complement its smoke-free policy, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) has ensured that all patients who smoke are supported, whether temporarily abstaining or starting a quit attempt.

Patients are offered NRT within 30 minutes of admission, as well as longer-term behavioural support to manage withdrawal symptoms. Those trying to quit can be referred to a specialist tobacco cessation adviser. E-cigarettes can also be used in specified areas on the site.

With this framework in place, SLaM’s smoke-free policy has not only encouraged patients to reduce their tobacco use, but has also seen the rate of physical assaults at the trust – both between patients and towards staff – drop by 39 per cent.

At what cost?
Under current financial conditions, policies like smoke-free estates may seem extracurricular. But, as the Five Year Forward View argues, preventative measures must be central to any efforts to reduce costs.

In London alone, it has been estimated that savings of around £2.6 million a year could be made if between 8 per cent and 17 per cent of smokers quit before having surgery.

The Welsh Government, which has since mandated smoke-free hospital grounds, has estimated that supporting smokers to quit before having surgery could save as much as £2.3 million every year. (These savings are derived from ‘bed days’ saved and the reduced cost of treating post-operative complications.)

Meanwhile, the Plan charts the cost of smoking to the economy as exceeding £11 billion per year, of which £2.5 billion was borne by the NHS. It has also been estimated that smoking increases the cost burden of social care to local authorities by a further £760 million.

What do the public think?
Public support for a ban on smoking in hospital grounds has grown in recent years. ASH’s Smoke-free Great Britain surveys, conducted by YouGov, show in that England agreement with the proposal stood at 62 per cent in 2011,1 rising to 69 per cent in 2014.2 In 2017, 72 per cent agreed, with only 15 per cent against the idea.3 Support for this measure is particularly pronounced in the north east, where rates of smoking-related illness and death are at their highest in England.

The verdict
Rolling out smoke-free NHS estates is not about making an example of smokers.

Instead – as the Plan makes clear – it is about enabling the NHS to lead by example. By creating an environment in which smoking cessation is fully supported, the NHS’s attempts to promote health and wellbeing can be strengthened.

It can also help to bolster the efforts of those who want to quit, at a time when the benefits of doing so are at their most stark.

(0,"Pregnancy and childbirth in prison: what do we know?","Dr Miranda Davies","The recent tragic death of a baby born at HMP Bronzefield raises serious questions about the care of pregnant women in prison in England, particularly when they are in labour. There has rightly been widespread condemnation of what happened, and the story has yet again highlighted how little we know about this small but vulnerable group of women.

There are currently 3,834 women in prison, and today the Guardian has published welcome new figures from NHS Digital about the numbers of births to women in custody or prison over five years. Yet prior to the tragedy in late September at HMP Bronzefield there were no formally reported figures of how many women in prison are pregnant and how many give birth in any given year.

The government has released some basic figures, indicating 47 pregnant women in prison on one specific day in October and fewer than five births in prison itself over the past year. But the means by which these figures were collected (a ‘bespoke counting exercise’) shows the lack of readily available and rigorous information in this area, and therefore the challenge of holding people to account when things go wrong.

What does Nuffield Trust analysis show?
Our forthcoming research will provide the most in-depth look yet at how prisoners are using hospital care, drawing on over 110,000 patient records. The full report will be published in the new year but today, as interest mounts on the topic of pregnancy and childbirth in prison, we publish some focused findings on this salient area of health care.

Our analysis found that, in 2017/18:

83 female prisoners were admitted to hospital for medical care relating to pregnancy or childbirth. 28 prisoners were in hospital for supervision of high-risk pregnancies.
A significant proportion of these women also had co-occurring mental health concerns, including 34 with tobacco-related issues, 26 with concerns related to opioid use and 23 experiencing depressive episodes.
There were more than 600 outpatient appointments for women in prison to attend midwifery services or obstetrics.
56 female prisoners gave birth during their prison stay, and over one in 10 of these (six prisoners) gave birth either in prison or on their way to hospital.
Being pregnant in prison
This week the Royal College of Midwives issued a call for pregnant prisoners to be given equivalent care to those outside of prison. Our research highlights a number of areas that need particular focus if this is to be achieved.

Where routine outpatient appointments are concerned, we can see that pregnant prisoners are experiencing fewer missed appointments than their non-pregnant counterparts in prison (22% of midwifery appointments compared to 39% of general outpatient appointments for women in prison). This suggests that prisons may be prioritising pregnant women’s health needs.

But when we compare outpatient appointments to the wider population, the numbers of missed appointments are far higher (22% of midwifery appointments compared to 14% in the wider population). This raises serious questions about whether pregnant women are able to access the same level of care as the wider population.

Moreover, the data also reveals that many of these women are admitted to hospital for supervision of high-risk pregnancies and that many of them have significant mental health needs. Clearly any policy to improve the outcomes of pregnant women in prison needs to be based in the reality that these patients have especially high needs.

Why shouldn’t women in prison give birth in their prison cell?
Our finding on the women that gave birth either in a prison cell or en route to hospital is worthy of particular focus. While the absolute number (six women) is small, this represents over one in 10 of all births that year. And yet prisons are in no way equipped to meet the needs of a woman in labour, or ensure the safe delivery of a baby.

For example, prisons are not staffed with round-the-clock midwives who are trained to support women in labour and know how labour is progressing, and there is no access to a range of pain relief options that a woman might use if she gave birth in hospital.

What’s more, the emotional impact of giving birth in a prison cell can be very significant. According to first-hand accounts, women prisoners often don’t feel that staff “believe” them when they say they are in labour. This may stem from the fact that the prison staff who are a first point of contact for a labouring prisoner are not health care professionals, and will inevitably have very different priorities.

Taken together with the finding that pregnant women in prison are likely to have significant co-occurring mental health problems, it is clear that this is a group of prisoners who are not being adequately supported at one of the most important and potentially stressful times of their life.

Caring for pregnant women in prison
The tragedy at HMP Bronzefield has rightly focused attention on the plight of female prisoners and the safety of prison as a place for pregnant women and their babies, prompting a further debate about the extent to which prison is ever the right place for pregnant women.

Answering this complex question is beyond the scope of our research, but our work makes clear that this is a small but highly vulnerable group of prisoners whose health needs are not being adequately met.

Surely it is not unreasonable, therefore, to expect that policy-makers can – and should – work harder to tailor services for pregnant women in prison. And if the death of a newborn baby behind bars doesn’t lead to real and lasting change, it is hard to know what will.",0,"Medicle","");

(0,"In discussion with: the 'digital doctor'","Robert Wachter MD","Why do you think the process of adopting technology into medicine has been so difficult?
I’ve studied the technological innovation and adaptations in other industries and it’s clear that our issues in health care are not unique. In medicine, we always tend to think that this is the first time the world has ever heard of these problems. This idea of the ‘productivity paradox’ – the lag between the adoption of technology and the realisation of productivity gains – is a well-known phenomenon. Technology enters industries and often those industries don’t quite know what to do with it. Perhaps they haven’t screwed it up quite as badly as we have in medicine, but technology never reaches its full potential at the very beginning.

There are a few reasons for that. One is the typical process of disruptive innovation: there are a lot of stakeholders that have an interest in the old way of working. And so the politics of changing things in a radical way are very complex.

But mostly, humans are generally just not very good at envisioning fundamental changes in the way they work. We tend to think incrementally. As a quote often attributed to Henry Ford goes, “If I’d asked people what they wanted, they would have said ‘faster horses’.”

Are there aspects of the health care profession that have made it more challenging?
A unique aspect of computer adoption in health care is that it didn't occur organically. In many other industries, what you saw was a very natural technology adoption curve, where you had early adopters and then laggards and then, eventually, everybody got there.

But, in health care, people were so resistant to ubiquitous technology – electronic health records, particularly – that it took a long time for it to happen. And then, when it did, at least in the US, it happened very quickly. So we went from essentially nothing to nearly everybody having electronic health records in three to five years.

The result of this is that nobody’s had the time to do the adaptation phase. In other industries, by the time the rank and file and the laggards adopt a technology, the early adopters have had it for 10 years and they’ve already traversed the curve, working out the bugs and developing a model that was replicable. That’s what we’ve been missing in health care.

How do we find our way out of the so-called ‘productivity paradox’?
Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT, who coined that phrase, said that the history of technology teaches us that, as it enters industries, people think it is going to be immediately transformative. In the business world, they think it’s going to revolutionise the industry, whether that be manufacturing, publishing or something else.

You need two keys to resolve the paradox. One of them is the technology, which of course needs to get better. But the second is that the work needs to be reimagined. You can’t just recreate your analogue processes with technology, without rethinking them. You need a new generation of leaders who are not wedded to a certain way of thinking, who are willing to challenge existing ways of working that are just no longer fit for purpose. Hospitals are now in a business where they are not going to be able to survive unless they demonstrably produce a high-quality, safe ’product‘ at the lowest cost. It’s not a theory any more: it feels very real. As people begin to reorganise, they are forced to consider how technology can help them to do that. That business case to improve performance is a very important adjunct to this.

Ultimately, work must be transformed, both by generational change within existing organisations but, very importantly, by technology serving as a fulcrum, an enabler, for new entrants into the market that had no access to the health care world before. And that’s everything from technology companies – whether it’s Google or Apple or start-ups – to patients and their advocates, now enabled and empowered by technology to transform a market that they previously had to be completely passive in.

Eventually, it has much more to do with the choices, the policy and the paradigms shifting, than it has to do with the actual interfaces and the software.

The tone at the end of your book is ultimately one of optimism for technology in health care. Do you still feel that way?
Believe me, when I started writing, I wasn’t doing it from a mindset of optimism! Ultimately, the reason I started writing the book in the first place was because I was disappointed. I had seen how remarkable IT could be in other aspects of my life, and how transformative it was in other industries. Yet I wasn’t seeing any of that in our own work.

That was what catalysed me to start writing the book, but I did go in with an open mind for the future. And the more I spoke to people, the more they cemented my feeling of disappointment with where we were. But they also solidified a feeling of hope. I could see the early forces, the early innovations and attitudes that will ultimately help us mature digital health care into something that really works.

It’s going to take a while, and we have to make some better decisions first. But, after a while, we will get there.

In this video, you’ll learn 7 advanced tips for taking your interview skills to the next level. There's a bonus tip at the end of the video.

Interviewing is an important part of the hiring process and it's vital to make a great impression during a job interview. There are certain skills that will help you succeed during that interview, including communication skills and professionalism. The more you understand about interview skills, the better prepared you'll be for your next interview.

In this article, we explore the definition of interview skills, as well as 10 skills that can help you ace your next job interview.What are interview skills?
Interview skills are skills or actions that allow a person to be more effective throughout the interview process for a new position. Not all interview skills are conventional; rather, many interview skills help candidates prepare for the interview and guide them as they participate in job interviews. Acing job interviews requires in-depth preparation as well as the ability to feel comfortable and confident when discussing your skills, experience and qualifications with hiring managers.10 interview skills that help you stand out as a candidate
The following are a few of the most important interview skills that can support the interview process and help set you apart from other candidates:

1. Research
Before you go into an interview, it's important to spend time researching both the company and the position you're applying for. There are several ways you can research an organization, including by:

Reviewing their website, especially the "About" page
Googling the company name and reading any press releases or other information available
Looking at the company's social media platforms
Talking to employees of the company, if possible
Researching job platforms that provide feedback from current and previous employees about the company
You should also take time to obtain as much information as possible about the job you are interviewing for. Thoroughly review the job listing, look on the company website for the job listing if available to see if additional details are included and look up current employees who hold the same or similar positions. You can also research the job title in general to get a more broad idea of what's expected and typical duties in that position. The more you know about the position, the better prepared you'll be when going into the interview.

2. Preparation
You should avoid going into an interview unprepared. Doing so may reflect negatively on you as a candidate, and most hiring managers can easily detect applicants who are not prepared. Set aside at least an hour to prepare the day before or on the day of the interview. Here are a few actions to take when preparing:

Re-read the job description and determine the most relevant responsibilities and requirements for the position.
Come up with several specific answers to potential questions related to the position you're applying for and the duties that will be expected of you.
Make a list of the essential aspects of the job so you have it on hand when answering and asking questions during the job interview.
Go over your cover letter and resume you provided to the company to ensure you remember how you initially presented yourself.
Spend several minutes or even hours researching possible interview questions related to the position you're applying for and the industry the company is part of.
Look up less specific interview questions that aren't directly related to the job, but may still be asked. For example, practice a few behavioral and situational interview questions.
Practice answering interview questions with a friend or family member so you feel comfortable when answering questions during the actual interview.
Prepare several specific examples from your previous job experience, including milestones, challenges and successes. These will support your interview answers and help strengthen your responses.
Look over your notes you prepared on the company during the research process to ensure the information is fresh in your mind when going into the interview.
3. Punctuality
On the day of the interview, make sure you arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled interview time. Punctuality is an important trait that hiring managers and employers value and gives them an idea of how punctual you will be on a daily basis if you are hired for the position.

To ensure you arrive on time, consider planning out your outfit the night before and ironing it so that it's ready the next day. You should also back your purse or briefcase the night before and ensure you have a copy of your resume and cover letter on hand. Set an alarm and make sure you have reliable transportation for the time of the interview.

4. Professionalism
There are several aspects that go into professionalism, and all of them are important when attending a job interview. To begin, ensure your attire is professional and tasteful and is neatly pressed and clean. Avoid wearing clothes that are too casual, too large or small, too revealing or too flamboyant. Aim for an outfit with neutral colors that match and are not distracting or offensive. If you are unsure of the dress code requirements for the interview, dress in a more formal way to avoid dressing too casually.

When arriving at the interview location, use professional language when checking in and greeting the interviewer. Be polite to everyone you come into contact with, including other employees and receptionists. The more polite and professional you are in your actions and words, the more kind and pleasant you can come off to employers.5. Communication
Good communication skills are crucial during the job interview process. This includes written, verbal and nonverbal communication skills. A few key tips to keep in mind when communicating with others during an interview include:

Address the interview by name and ensure you pronounce the name or names correctly.
Begin the interview with appropriate small talk. It's best to come prepared with a few conversation starters that are professional and conducive to an interview setting.
Match your communication style to the hiring manager. For example, if the hiring manager is communicating in a professional way, try to match your tone to theirs. If they are more upbeat and offer jokes here and there, don't be afraid to do the same as long as they're appropriate.
Avoid interrupting the person you are interviewing with when they are speaking.
Don't use jargon or abbreviated language when speaking with the interviewer.
Try to avoid using speech fillers like "um" and "like."
Copy the interviewer's body language. For example, if they are sitting in an upright position with their hands on the table, do the same.
Be aware of your own body language to ensure you are presenting yourself in a professional and positive way.

6. Listening
Listening skills are another important component of a successful interview experience. It's easy to listen to a person speak, and while doing so to think to yourself how you will respond. While this may seem wise, it can also prevent you from actually hearing what the other person is saying. Listen attentively when the hiring manager is speaking, paraphrase what they said either in your mind or out loud when appropriate and use nonverbal cues such as nodding, making eye contact and leaning in when the other person is talking.

You should also ask for clarification if you misunderstand something that was said to ensure communication is effective. Avoid quickly changing the subject and take note of any nonverbal cues the interviewer is giving you, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, to further understand what's being said.

7. Ask questions
Hiring managers often ask candidates if they have any questions during or after the interview. Interviewers look for candidates who ask genuine questions to help them gain a better understanding of the company and the role. Arrive at the interview prepared with a few questions to ask the interviewer that demonstrates a genuine interest in the opportunity and provides a chance to further discuss elements of the job that may not have been covered.

8. Confidence
Confidence has a significant impact on how you are perceived by interviewers. Arrive at the interview ready to discuss your experience, accomplishments and abilities in a confident way that conveys your own belief in yourself to perform the duties of the position you applied for. Work to exude a balanced and kind sense of confidence rather than simply boasting about your qualifications.

9. Showing interest
It's important to convey your genuine interest in the position during a job interview. If you give off a sense of disinterest or apathy, the interviewer may think you don't truly want the position or care about the outcome of the interview. Work to show earnest interest in the organization and position and a passion for your work and your abilities to complete the duties of the job.

10. Follow-up
Following up soon after an interview is considered crucial by many recruiters and hiring managers. A simple thank-you card or thank-you email can go a long way to show the interviewer you are genuinely interested in the position and are grateful for their time. Try to send a follow-up email or note the same day as the interview or the next day at the latest.",0,"Interview",""),
(0,"Strategies of Effective Interviewing","Samuel G. Trull","The executive engaged in the normal conduct of business devotes much of his time to interviewing. However, there is an appalling lack of effort given to systematic attempts at building improvements into this age-old process. Interviewing remains one of those activities which we think we know all about merely because we have been doing it so long; we have been lulled by habit. It seems apparent that a modest effort aimed at an analysis of our interviewing techniques would yield generous returns.

In the broad sense, interviewing is the process whereby individuals (usually two) exchange information. The individuals may be concerned with a job opening, a promotion, a special assignment, a product sale, information for intelligence purposes, a proposed merger, or other questions. The information exchanged need not be limited to facts. In business, particularly, such products of an interview as meaning and understanding are oftentimes more significant than objective factual statements.

Interviewing in the contemporary business setting invariably takes place in an atmosphere filled with a sense of urgency. The time allocated to the interview is necessarily limited. Consequently, a nondirective approach finds little application; it is necessary to use the guided interview in the vast majority of situations. This inherent time constraint sometimes brings about dysfunctional consequences: the interviewer is so preoccupied with budgeting his time that the content and the purpose of the interview are vitiated. Hence, we must define what we mean by an effective interview. For the purposes of this article, an effective interview is one that optimizes the perceived communication objectives of the individuals involved, with time as the principal constraint. We shall focus on research findings concerning:

The proper kind of preparation for the interview.
Value of such procedures as having an outline of points to be covered and taking notes.
Use (and misuse) of questions and questioning techniques.
The kind and amount of control that the interviewer should exercise over the discussion.
Analysis and evaluation of information obtained.
Planning & Preparation
The lack of adequate planning for an interview is the greatest single fault found in my studies of the interviewing process.1 All too often, the inexperienced interviewer launches into a discussion only to find midway through that his preparation is incomplete. A moderate amount of preplanning can easily obviate such unfortunate occurrences.

When the objective of the interview is well-known in advance, it is usually a good practice to allow the individual concerned ample time to prepare for the talk before the actual involvement. By indicating, ahead of time and in writing, the points to be covered, the interviewer gives the interviewee an added advantage and reinforces the specific purpose of the session. Too often the expectations of the interviewee may be far different from those of the interviewer. This misunderstanding, if not corrected, can be disastrous.

On the other hand, too much preplanning and detailing for an interview can be equally harmful. The interviewee may then develop conventionally correct answers or platitudes which, of course, reduce the informational content of the interview to virtually zero. In short, he needs a guide, a “steer”—but no more than that.

A written outline of important points to be covered is not necessarily an indication of rigidity; rather, it reflects consideration for all parties concerned. When explained, it generates a feeling of confidence as well as fairness—particularly if two or more people are to be ranked in an evaluation. The outline may even include typical questions in order to solicit comparable responses. Again, however, a warning against excess is needed: too much reliance on a programed questioning approach is often disconcerting to the interviewee and may lead to stereotyped answers. Ideally, of course, each question should be designed for the situation and the respondent.

In presenting information, a speaker allocates blocks of time to various items on his agenda. If no time limit is established, the presentation can continue indefinitely. Even worse, the truly important information may never be told. This process takes place by dint of the normal human trait of retaining the most significant bits of information for the end. Psychiatrists recognize this and are particularly attentive in the last ten minutes of the therapy session. Borrowing from this insight, the interviewer, although not able to set an hourly cycle as does the psychiatrist, should try discreetly to indicate a time scale. This allows the interviewee to plan and to include relevant information which otherwise might be withheld. If the interview is terminated too abruptly, the probability of losing valuable information is very high.

A time limit can be suggested by citing the next appointment or by noting, perhaps, a previously scheduled conference. Actions such as tapping—consciously or not—on one’s watch to indicate time are out of order, of course; so is sitting precipitously on the edge of the chair. Sometimes it may be in the best interest of both parties to set another date for an extended session or to plan on completing only one or two stages of progress at a time.

Building Rapport
Certainly the general tone of the interview should be one of helpfulness and friendliness so as to minimize the immediate barriers to forthright communication. In this connection it should be mentioned that privacy is a first prerequisite to good interviewing. An important component of this is freedom from distracting interruptions. (The telephone many times is such a distraction.)

In order to establish the critically important element of rapport with the interviewee, a genuine attempt should be made to put the interviewee at ease—especially in job application, promotion, or other interviews where significant differences in status exist. Unfortunately, sometimes this rapport is attempted by such gaucheries as, “Now, don’t be nervous!” or, “Relax!”
Normally, at the beginning of an interview an allowance should be made for the interviewee to adjust to the interview environment. The situation is new for the interviewee; it may be his or her first experience of this kind. Unless there is a specified adaptation period, the interviewee may be unable to reduce his or her level of anxiety, with the resulting loss of the entire session. Part of this adaptive process is familiarization with the surroundings. It is an often overlooked truism that whenever an individual is placed in a strange situation, he becomes apprehensive.

Overcoming this fear is often a most difficult procedure. By explaining, for example, the need for commonplace objects such as pencil and note paper that are anxiety-provoking, the level of tension may be reduced. Also, it is well to remember that the manner and simple courtesies extended by the interviewer are greatly magnified in the eyes of the interviewee. Thus, a limited amount of pleasantries may be condoned if they fulfill this useful purpose.

By jotting down significant bits of information, the interviewer can readily reconstruct what actually took place. The record assists with details which would be hard to remember if not recorded. The time that would be needed to fix them in mind without benefit of notes can be used to greater advantage listening and thinking. Then, too, writing down items compliments the interviewee; it means that his responses are considered important enough to be recorded. It is a convenient reinforcing mechanism; it may even be used to guide the path of the interview.

Information of a picayune variety should naturally be avoided. Similarly, allowing the interviewee to relate too much information can be dangerous. Any inadvertently revealed facts or incidents may bring about severe anxiety feelings when he or she reflects on them later. Temptations to divulge information too freely should be sidestepped as lightly as possible so that continued rapport may be maintained. In addition, circumspection should be exercised at all times lest the interviewer become too emotionally involved in the exchange. Disagreements tend to provoke planning for verbal counterattacks with the result that the informational content is lost.

Guiding the conversation
The interviewee is overly sensitive to all reactions by the interviewer. Taking advantage of this, the interviewer may easily steer the conversation along the most productive channels. Small inflections in the voice give encouragement. By repeating phrases already expressed, one finds the respondent expanding with details on a relevant issue. Sometimes, merely restating the reply allows a time for reflection and quite natural expansion or clarification of a point perhaps lost in the first verbalization. Phrasing a question by rewording it into a rhetorical one gives the interviewee a period to think through a definite response (although caution should be observed that the “right” words are not put into the mind of the interviewee).

Support given by nodding is most effective. Other nonverbal means of rendering assistance are equally significant. The use of semiverbal expressions of a meaningless nature—for instance, “Umm…”—can prove most useful. Because such utterances provide no direct interpretation, they are received as the interviewee wants to receive them. He then emphasizes or magnifies the point as he sees fit.

A succinct summary of information from time to time not only allows for clarity in the communication process but also gives the informant a mirror of just what has occurred. Alterations can be made easily by the interviewee once he hears what he has said. In the final stage, a precise statement of what was agreed on or of the general conclusions reached often allows for a reduction of confusion.

When details or figures have been discussed, the summary can often be in the form of a written memorandum. If the interviewer wants to be sure of what the interviewee communicated or to check on whether the interviewee really understood the data discussed, he can ask him to write the memorandum.
Developing Information
The tools of the interviewer are his questions. They should be used with dispatch and yet with the utmost care. Sarcasm or obscure humor should be avoided unless the interviewer is positive that the interviewee perceives them as such. Usually, the latter’s interpretation of such activity is entirely serious; he or she may respond at the time with a semblance of perceived humor, but the real reaction is often deep concern and suspicion.

Through the judicious use of questions, the skilled interviewer not only obtains information but also guides the talk along productive lines. Leading questions or questions designed with built-in responses are usually not very effective. Similarly, the double negative type of interrogation is to be shunned as it tends to evoke anxiety. To avoid slipping into such traps, even the best interviewer should review his questioning techniques from time to time. Thus, self-analyzing by tape recording or by having a third person observe an interview for diagnostic purposes can prevent poor techniques from developing into set procedures. This process may be extended to the use of video tape recordings with proportionately more significant results.

In a research project that concentrated on questioning techniques, I analyzed the recordings of about 100 interviews held for the purpose of selecting job applicants, appraising executive performance, or counseling employees in their careers. One of the conclusions from this study is this: successful interviewers (as evaluated by information obtained) utilize at the outset of the interview a pattern of broad, general questions. Apparently this allows the respondent to answer with information which he feels is important, as well as providing him the opportunity to expand into areas that he deems to be of vital concern. Once this information is released, the interviewer can sharpen the focus with specific questions eliciting short answers. For example, the “yes or no” kind of question should be reserved for the final exploration of a subject, while queries such as “How do you feel about working with Joe Smith’s group?” might well obtain results most useful at the beginning of a particular subject.

Fear of silence
It seems that silence in our society is to be avoided at virtually all times and all places. Unfortunately, this feeling affects the interview. Usually fear of silence is felt most by the inexperienced interviewer. All too often he tends to put forth another question while the respondent is meekly attempting to formulate his own thoughts into a logical reply—all just to keep the air filled with words.

The tendency to hurry questions and answers is compounded by the distorted sense of time that people get during an interview. To understand the amount of distortion, one research group carried out such simple tests as stopping a conversation for a short period. Interviewers’ estimates of the period of silence magnified it by a factor of from 10 to 100!2 On the other hand, I find, when asking participants in an interview to estimate the time elapsed, invariably the interviewee underestimates the period. Consequently, the interviewer in particular should be cautious of pushing forward too quickly. In many instances, if he will permit another few seconds to elapse, he will obtain vital bits of information that would otherwise be lost or allowed to remain in a half-expressed state in the interviewee’s thought processes.

During these periods of silence, the interviewer may profitably spend his time pondering the question: “What is he really trying to tell me?” Often the content of the interview makes an incomplete story when analyzed later on. Not only may the words fall far short of the desired goal, but also they may convey misunderstandings. Allowances for the ever-present failures in semantics must constantly be made, and further interrogation conducted, in order that a clear approximation of the true meaning be obtained.

Art of listening
The often posed maxim to the effect that we hear what we wish to hear does not appear at first glance to be a profound statement. Yet it summarizes the mechanics that lie behind poor listening techniques. Individual biases and attitudes as well as role perceptions and stereotyping all contribute to the phenomenon of selective perception. Thus, in order to obtain the best possible information, it is necessary that one be aware of his own particular filters that tend to impede if not prevent clear and relatively undistorted reception of information.

It is possible to hear at the rate of from 110 to 140 words per minute over sustained periods.3 The thinking or thought projection rate is approximately seven times this figure. The result is a surplus of thinking time over listening time. The manner in which this surplus time is utilized varies, of course, with the individual. However, it is at this point that the interviewer tends to project his ideas into the interview process, thereby filtering out the interviewee’s responses.
One result is that he makes assumptions about the respondent and his information that are compatible not so much with the interviewee as with what the interviewer has already concluded about the interviewee. Suffice it to say that it is altogether more rewarding to spend this extra time in formulating hypotheses, which later can be confirmed or denied as more information is revealed, or in constructing a frame of reference for the on-going interview, which allows acquired information to be categorized easily as it is given.",0,"Interview",""),

(0,"Anonymous","Claudia Leone","Mental health nurses are vital to the delivery of mental health services. They are not only the largest clinical profession dedicated to mental health, but they also bring unique expertise to managing both mental and physical health and in coordinating care. They are considered a priority, and last year NHS England outlined the need for 4,220 more mental health nurses by 2024.

In our new report, Laying foundations: attitudes and access to mental health nurse education, we explore the main factors that affect how likely people are to apply for mental health nursing courses. This blog highlights some of the key findings.

Underlying challenges 
Even before Covid-19, it was challenging to ensure there were enough nurses in NHS-funded mental health services. There are at least 3,400 fewer full-time equivalent mental health nurses in hospital and community settings than a decade ago. In every region, mental health services currently have a higher-than-average proportion of nurse posts that are not permanently filled.  

Filling these posts is harder than it is for many other clinical roles as, for example, only a small number of countries have specialised mental health nurse education like in the UK, which makes direct international recruitment less feasible. To compound matters, there is also a higher proportion of mental health nurses approaching retirement age than is the case for nurses in acute services.

The effect of the pandemic
Covid-19 has changed the policy landscape and introduced new dimensions to the discussion about recruiting the future NHS workforce. It has certainly exacerbated the pressure on services already struggling to meet rising demand – adversely affecting both the general population and in particular those with pre-existing mental health disorders.

As is clear from recent headlines, the pandemic is also changing university life, with modified teaching methods and a reduction of face-to-face life on campus adding to the well-documented impact on students’ education and experience.

However, there is evidence of more interest in health and care careers, as well as a rise in mental health nursing applications. While this is welcome, this increase in interest should not overshadow the underlying challenges of ensuring a sufficient and sustainable supply of mental health nurses.

Demand for mental health nursing courses
There appears to be a general lack of awareness of the mental health nursing role, and limited understanding about what it does and where can it work. In particular, some of the students we spoke to suggested that the most common perception among their friends, relatives and wider society was that the role would predominantly mean working with potentially dangerous people with serious mental health conditions and in forensic settings. This is a problem, and belies the wide variety of roles, settings and specialties that mental health nurses work in.

There has been a failure to promote the unique value of mental health nursing to act as a bridge between mental and physical conditions – to distinguish them from other mental health professionals and to raise their societal profile. Instead, the profession is affected by both clichéd views of “nurse” and stigma around “mental health”, which is contributing to an inaccurate image of the work.

For prospective students, the ever-growing number of psychological professions, and a general lack of clarity about the differences between them, are also a source of confusion. A recent survey reiterated that while some people are aware of long-standing professions, such as psychiatrists, few have heard of other less-known professions, like psychological wellbeing practitioners.

Supply of mental health nursing courses
Stimulating interest in mental health careers alone will not be enough. The way in which mental health nurse courses are currently distributed fails to offer equitable access to the profession for people from different regions, backgrounds and circumstances. As it stands, the provision of undergraduate courses across England is patchy. For instance, for those unwilling or unable to relocate or travel long distances, there may be limited opportunities to study mental health nursing in areas of the south and east of England.

The offer is even more limited for dual awards (including mental health), which offer more flexibility on graduation and postgraduate courses, and which are a shorter route for those already with a degree. There are currently only 14 and 37 universities with these courses, respectively. This may be particularly problematic, given that mental health nursing has typically attracted older students who may have less flexibility to travel. Given too that students are likely to work in the same region as where they studied, this geographical imbalance on where courses are offered is far from ideal.

Opportunities in unusual times but action is required
Our research nonetheless shows there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of the mental health nursing workforce. The students we spoke to were positive about their choice of course, and recognised the value of the mental health nursing role and the importance of encouraging others to consider mental health nursing as a career. But there are still areas that require action, and given the current workforce shortages and the rising demand of mental health services, that action is required now.

In our report, we make a range of suggestions for different national bodies and higher education institutions on how to improve the demand for mental health nursing, with the key areas for action summarised in the box below. Given the importance of the profession, it is vital they are addressed as a matter of urgency.

What will help to increase demand for mental health nursing?

Ensure a more accurate and realistic image of the mental health nursing role, career options, work settings and the people mental health nurses care for.

Promote the valuable contribution that mental health nurses have made during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the uniqueness of mental health nursing to be able to act as a bridge between mental and physical conditions.

Coordinate efforts to provide access to positive personal experiences of and exposure to mental health services and staff, including by sharing good practice.

Encourage mental health nursing across the breadth of the population, including different genders, ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses.

Improve understanding of the support available, routes and requirements for studying to become a mental health nurse.

Ensure that the full range of routes into mental health nursing are available across the whole country to increase numbers and broaden participation.",0,"Skill",""),
